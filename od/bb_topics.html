	<h3 class="hprb"><a name="survey"></a>Surveillance</strong></h3>
	
	<p><strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>DCCPS and CDC’s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control (DCPC) have a memorandum of understanding between NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries to coordinate collecting and reporting cancer incidence and mortality data. The memorandum provides a model framework for collaboration and promotes new efforts to communicate up-to-date, high quality, and comprehensive cancer data to the many cancer constituencies served by CDC and NCI. Staff from both agencies frequently co-author peer-reviewed publications on all aspects of cancer surveillance.</li><br /><br />
	  
	  <li>DCCPS and CDC are collaborating to initiate a national consensus informatics model of cancer registry function. The model will be used as a reference for transmission, management, and analysis of cancer registry data.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The SEER-Medicare data include individuals’ clinical and vital status information, collected by the SEER registries, that is linked to their Medicare claims across the health care system. These data are used by researchers to conduct surveillance and health services research examining the economics of cancer care, use of screening procedures, patterns of care during initial treatment, variation in care among diverse groups, and differences in initial treatment between health maintenance organization and fee-for-service patients. Of people aged 65 and older in the SEER data, 93 percent have been linked to Medicare’s master enrollment file. SEER-Medicare data currently include over one million cases. NCI and CMS are working to link SEER to the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey to improve the surveillance of health-related quality of life.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Indian Health Service (IHS)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Over the last ten years, health care for Northwest American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) has evolved from a centralized system maintained by the IHS to a diverse and complex delivery environment. The Northwest Tribal Registry Project was developed in January 1999 as a tribally-operated program located at the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board in Oregon. Through an interagency agreement with IHS, the existing disease registry initiated record linkage studies with state cancer registries in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington. This will significantly improve the accuracy of data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as cancer among Northwest AI/AN.</li><br /><br />
	
	  <li>In 2003 and again in 2005, NCI funded SEER registries to link data to the IHS patient registration database. This effort is aimed at addressing racial misclassification in the cancer registries, and although not perfect, it is a logical step in the process of identifying additional cancer cases among American Indian populations. The process will become a continuing project for SEER. In related work, DCCPS is supporting the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board to conduct linkages with the IHS databases in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington.</li><br /><br />

	  <li>The Alaska Native Tumor Registry was initiated in 1974 in collaboration with CDC. It became a SEER member in 2000. The registry reports annually on cancer rates in Alaska Natives in cooperation with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, covering all eight IHS service units in the state.</li> 
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>American Cancer Society (ACS)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The DCCPS SEER Program partners with ACS, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, NIA, and CDC—including the National Center for Health Statistics—to publish the <em>Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer</em>.</li><br /><br />
	  
	  <li>DCCPS scientists developed and validated a more accurate method for predicting cancer mortality counts. This method was instituted by ACS beginning with the 2004 edition of <em>Cancer Facts and Figures</em> and continuing with the 2005 and 2006 editions.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>American College of Surgeons (ACoS)<br />
	Commission on Cancer</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>DCCPS has been working with the ACoS Commission on Cancer, along with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and other organizations to implement the Collaborative Staging System, which will standardize the guidelines for collecting cancer data in the United States. With this advancement, a computer algorithm unifies the various coding systems used by cancer registries.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Based on population-level data of ovarian cancer diagnosed in 1991, NCI identified that women with early-stage ovarian cancer were not receiving any nodal sampling to fully define their disease stage at diagnosis. To enhance understanding of the need for more complete nodal sampling, NCI developed an Ovarian Cancer Treatment Consensus Development Conference and further worked with ASCO, the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to provide education about appropriate treatment for ovarian cancer. Subsequent monitoring of quality of care through patterns and quality of care studies within the SEER Program indicate that rates of nodal sampling have improved, particularly in groups with the lowest rates in 1991.</li>

	<ul>
	  <li>DCCPS collaborates with DCEG on several high-priority areas, including the implementation of NCI’s Special Studies Institutional Review Board, and leadership of NCI’s strategic priorities in the areas of molecular epidemiology and genes and the environment. DCEG is also a partner in projects to facilitate the development of consortia of cohort and case-control studies.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>DCCPS and NIEHS cosponsor four Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Centers. The centers are studying—through both laboratory and epidemiologic research—the prenatal-to-adult environmental exposures that may predispose a woman to breast cancer.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>DCCPS is participating in a global network of genetic and molecular epidemiology consortia, the Network of Investigator Networks (NoN). The network aims to bring interdisciplinary large-scale science to bear on advancing human genome epidemiology. It is a resource to share information, provide methodological support, develop inclusive overviews of specific fields, and facilitate rapid confirmation of findings. The network was launched by the Human Genome Epidemiology Network (HuGENet), an initiative led by the CDC’s National Office of Public Health Genomics.</li><br /><br />

	  <li>DCCPS is participating with the steering committee for the World Trade Center Responder Consortium, which is monitoring the health status of workers and volunteers involved in the response to the attack on the World Trade Center. CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is funding the initiative.</li><br /><br />

	  <li>DCCPS established the Interagency Cancer Epidemiology Research Funders Group (ICERF) to provide a forum for federal agencies that fund cancer epidemiology to share and exchange information and ideas. DCCPS and CDC are working together to expand participation from other agencies.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>DCCPS is cosponsoring with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) three research projects that are part of the Pharmacogenetics Research Network (PGRN), which is a nationwide collaboration of scientists studying the effects of genetic variation on individuals’ responses to a wide variety of medicines. The funding supports translational use of biotechnology to understand the basis of human genetic variability in drug responses related to cancer risk or treatment.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>American College of Epidemiology</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>DCCPS cosponsors the annual meeting of the American College of Epidemiology (ACE) and helps set the program agenda and identify speakers. The conference is an important opportunity to disseminate information about DCCPS funding opportunities and NCI/DCCPS activities and resources to leading investigators in cancer epidemiology. It is also a major forum for the exchange of information on research developments.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
	
	<h3 class="hprb"><a name="qc"></a>Quality of Care</h3>
	<p><strong>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>NCI supported the HMO Research Network annual meeting in May 2006. The HMO Research Network is an organization of HMO research programs whose mission is to use their collective scientific capabilities to integrate research and practice for the improvement of health and healthcare among diverse populations. Activities include the NCI-funded Cancer Research Network, a network of 15 HMO-affiliated research organizations, and the Centers for Education and Research in Therapeutics (CERT), an initiative funded by AHRQ to conduct research and provide education that optimizes the use of drugs, devices, and biological products.</li><br /><br />

	  <li>The fourth in a series on translating or increasing the flow of research knowledge into health care practice and policy, the Translating Research into Practice and Policy (TRIPP) 2006 Conference was held in July 2006 by NCI and AHRQ. The conference highlighted strategies and tools for designing interventions to reach and influence different audiences and to promote change in different settings where evidence-based practices might be implemented.</li><br /><br />

	  <li>In collaboration with AHRQ, NCI funded the Health Care Systems as Research Summit in September 2005. The focus of the summit was development and maintenance of delivery-related resources in order to foster collaborations among cancer research and health care delivery organizations. The ultimate goal is to ensure that research is relevant to care, integrated into delivery, and disseminated, to accelerate progress in reducing the burden of cancer.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>American Cancer Society (ACS)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>NCI staff participated in the annual meeting of the National Colorectal Cancer Round Table (NCCRT) on November 4, 2005, where they reported NCI’s current data on colorectal cancer screening utilization. They also provided updates on current NCI-sponsored colorectal cancer screening studies, including the Health Plan Survey, CISNET, and the National CT Colonography Trial conducted by American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>American College of Radiology (ACR)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The NCI-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), an effort to evaluate the performance of screening mammography in practice, provided standardized data forms and a dictionary to ACR to enhance the capacity to collect standardized data on mammography performance in software vending programs throughout the United States. In addition, data from the BCSC were central to the recent revision of the BIRADSTM Manual that is used by radiologists across the U.S.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>American Medical Association (AMA)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>NCI has provided technical assistance to AMA’s Physician Consortium on Performance Improvement (a group of 60 medical specialty societies) to develop performance measures for breast and colorectal cancer screening.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The National Initiative on Cancer Care Quality (NICCQ) was formed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to develop a prototype for a national system that could monitor the quality of cancer care. Funded primarily by the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the study was initiated in 2000. The goals of NICCQ were to develop potential measures of the quality of cancer care for two common cancers (breast and colorectal cancer), to ascertain current practice for these two diseases, and to design and implement the first phase of a prototype quality monitoring system. Results were presented at the May 2005 ASCO annual meeting.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>NCI and CDC’s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control are cosponsoring a national survey of health plan medical directors to examine colorectal cancer screening practices in managed care organizations. This is a follow-up of a similar survey fielded in 1999-2000 to examine changes in policies, procedures, and performance.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>NCI staff are collaborating with CMS to analyze data on recent trends in the utilization of FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy by Medicare recipients. These rates are being compared to data from the National Health Interview Survey and the National Ambulatory Care Survey, conducted by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics, on the use of these tests by individuals over and under the age of 65.</li><br /><br />

	  <li>In 2003, NCI staff and grantees worked with AHRQ and CMS staff to produce a cost effectiveness analysis to inform a CMS coverage decision regarding the immunochemical fecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer screening—a type of test previously not covered by Medicare. As a result of this study, a decision was made to extend Medicare coverage to this type of test.</li><br /><br  />
	
	  <li>NCI is working with the CMS Office of Clinical Standards and Quality to explore the development of a colorectal cancer screening initiative. NCI is working with CMS staff to develop a proposal for a series of pilot projects as part of the CMS Doctors Office Quality Information Technology Project to test the ability of enhanced office-based information technology to improve colorectal cancer screening rates and appropriate follow-up for abnormal results.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Health Research and Services Administration (HRSA)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>NCI, HRSA, and CDC, in partnership with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, work with 21 community health clinics to implement strategies that improve screening, referral, and followup care for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment. The effort is now expanding in collaboration with leadership in the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) in order to develop a "train the trainer" model of dissemination. Together with BPHC and CDC, NCI is working with four health plans in the Northeast to train their staff in the collaborative approach to implementing planned cancer screening within their facilities. The goal is to develop an approach that can reach the 800 clinics of the BPHC and more than 16 million people they serve.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>National Quality Forum</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>In collaboration with AHRQ, CDC, and CMS, NCI has supported the creation of the Cancer Care Quality Measures Project (CanQual), conducted by the National Quality Forum, to identify a core set of quality of care measures for cancer. The appointed steering committee for CanQual includes individuals closely associated with a range of public and private organizations, including ACS, the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American College of Radiology, the Oncology Nursing Society, the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, the National Cancer Policy Board of the Institute of Medicine, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and the National Committee for Quality Assurance.</li>

	<p><strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The mission of the World Health Organization Tobacco Free Initiative Study Group for Tobacco Regulation (WHO-TFI) is to reduce the global burden of disease and death caused by tobacco, and to protect present and future generations from the harmful health consequences of tobacco consumption and tobacco smoke exposure. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Tobacco Product Regulation (SACTob) was established in 2000 to provide comprehensive scientific research, information, and recommendations to inform tobacco policies and regulation. In November 2003, SACTob was formalized from a scientific committee to a study group and renamed the Study Group for Tobacco Regulation (TobReg). TobReg provides a mechanism for reporting to WHO's governing bodies, and for drawing the attention of member states to WHO's efforts in this novel and complex area of tobacco control. NCI scientists have worked with SACTob/TobReg since November 2002 on the development of numerous recommendations aimed at improving public health and scientific research related to the effects of tobacco use.</li><br /><br />
	  
	  <li>Since 2004, NCI has been collaborating with WHO’s Tobacco Laboratory Network (TobLabNet) to address research issues related to the establishment of global capacity for tobacco product testing and research. TobLabNet collaborates with other networks such as the Tobacco Harm Reduction Network and the European Network of Government Laboratories on Tobacco and Tobacco Products, and with researchers across the world to advance research on tobacco product testing.</li><br /><br />

	  <li>In 2006, NCI will be participating in the collaborative project between WHO-TFI and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to establish upper limits of toxin emissions in cigarette smoke. To achieve the project goal, TobReg Working Group I has been convened and charged to develop criteria for selection of constituents based on availability of toxicity data, and variability of constituent levels by brand, and developing science-based recommendations for advancing knowledge on tobacco products and their regulation.</li>

	<p><strong>Office of Medical Applications of Research (OMAR)</strong></p>
	
	<p>On June 12-14, 2006, NCI co-sponsored the NIH State-of-the-Science Conference &#34;Tobacco Use: Prevention, Cessation and Control&#34; in collaboration with the Office of Medical Applications of Research (OMAR). The goal of the conference was to gain a better understanding of how effective tobacco use prevention and treatment strategies can be developed and implemented across diverse segments of the population.</p>

	<p>Noted experts presented research findings on the various aspects of tobacco control, discussing such issues as the role of culture in prevention and cessation programs, policy perspectives and interventions, consumer demand, strategies for specific populations, and health systems changes. In addition, several presenters discussed the need to create innovative prevention and cessation strategies that target specific populations, such as cultural groups (especially black and Latino populations), blue-collar workers, and individuals with low income.</p>
	
	<p>A panel, composed of experts—none involved in tobacco research—from various fields was charged with developing an unbiased state-of-thescience statement that described the evidence currently available as well as the research needed. In developing its statement, the panel considered not only the scientific evidence presented by invited experts in tobacco-control research, a systematic literature review of some of the key aspects of the conference, and written comments submitted in advance of the conference, but also numerous comments and issues raised by members of the audience. More than 600 professionals in health care and health care policy attended the conference and were encouraged to provide public comment.</p>
	
	<p>The panel concluded that tobacco use remains a very serious public health problem. Coordinated national strategies for tobacco prevention, cessation, and control are essential if the United States is to achieve the <em>Healthy People 2010</em> goals. Most adult smokers want to quit, and effective interventions exist. However, only a small proportion of tobacco users try treatment. This gap represents a major national quality-of-care problem. Many cities and states have implemented effective policies to reduce tobacco use; public health and government leaders should learn from these experiences.</p>
	
	<p>Because smokeless tobacco use may increase in the United States, it will be increasingly important to understand net population harms related to use of smokeless tobacco. Prevention, especially among youth, and cessation are the cornerstones of strategies to reduce tobacco use. Tobacco use is a critical and chronic problem that requires close attention from health care providers, health care organizations, and research support organizations. </p>
