	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Time Issues in Multi-level Interventions for Cancer Treatment and Prevention</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">by Jeff Alexander, PhD</span></p>
	<p>This paper will explore how time (and timing) introduce important complexities in the design of multilevel interventions and in modeling behavior and expected results of such interventions. The paper will address: a) time as a level embedded within individual patients; b) temporal aspects of intervention implementation, fidelity, and sustainability; c) analytic techniques for incorporating time in models of multilevel interventions, and d) costs and benefits of incorporating time in evaluations of multilevel interventions.</p>
