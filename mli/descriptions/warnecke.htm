	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Linking Multilevel Approaches to Issues in Health Policy</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">by Richard Warnecke, PhD</span></p>
	<p>As health care reform is being considered and advanced, solutions being proposed for the delivery of health care begin with addressing access issues by reducing financial barriers. This paper uses breast cancer as a marker of health care delivery and analyzes how the view from communities facing health disparities provides insights for policy. The role of multilevel research in addressing gaps in our knowledge will also be addressed.</p>
