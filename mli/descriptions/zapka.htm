	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Multilevel Factors Impacting Quality: Examples from the Cancer Care Continuum</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">by Jane Zapka, ScD</span></p>
	<p>The purpose of this paper is to use case scenarios representing two types of care (screening and survivorship) to: a) illustrate the variability, diversity, and interaction of factors from multiple levels that impact the quality of care delivery across the cancer continuum; and b) discuss implications for research and provide examples of multilevel interventions. The overall goal of such interventions is to have a positive impact on care as indicated by the characteristics of quality care, and ultimately affect morbidity and mortality.</p>
