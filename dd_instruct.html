        <strong>Available Funds:</strong> $375,000<br />
        <strong>Request Letter Receipt Deadline:</strong> May 30, 2005<br />
        <strong>First Possible Award Date: </strong> September 1, 2005</p>
		
		<h4><a name="elig"></a>Eligibility Requirements</h4>
		
		<p>Request letters for administrative supplemental funding may be submitted by National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded cancer control intervention research RO1, P01, P50, U01, and U19 grantees (domestic applicant institutions only), as long as the following conditions are met:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The focus of the dissemination administrative supplement that is being proposed is similar to the focus of the cancer control intervention for the existing awarded grant;</li>
		  <li>There are no funds in the related award related to the proposed dissemination effort;</li>
		  <li>There must be an active parent grant during the entire funding period of this administrative supplement; and </li>
		  <li>The Principal Investigator for the administrative supplement must be the Principal Investigator of the parent grant. </li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Foreign institutions are not eligible under this supplemental funding initiative.</p>
		
		<p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
		
		<h4><a name="researchO"></a>Research Objective</h4>
		
		<p>The purpose of these administrative supplements is to fund the dissemination of promising interventions and products that have been developed and tested in the original R01, P01, P50, U01, or U19 (Type 1) project. These interventions include those for which statistical significance and potential public health/clinical significance suggest the merits of dissemination to the broader population from which the intervention study sample was originally drawn. Applicants should also pay attention to improvements in the intervention approach in the light of any recent developments in the field.  Moreover, there must be strong evidence presented in the application that the target populations and the organizations serving those populations support adoption. Applicants are encouraged to consider projects that examine cost-effectiveness of interventions shown to have efficacy. Study designs other than the traditional randomized controlled trial may be appropriate to capture key process measures of adaptation, implementation, adoption, and sustainability.  Study outcomes should not be limited to individual level behavior change; outcomes should include measures at an organizational level regarding program adoption and use.  Applications may also address modification of existing interventions to fit practical needs for implementation among larger segments of target populations or larger numbers of organizational structures.  Applicants may propose qualitative or quantitative studies regarding the adaptation and suitability of interventions.  Regardless of study focus, proposed projects should have clear specific aims and strong evaluation components. Intervention research across the cancer control continuum that may be eligible for these supplements includes: prevention and cessation of tobacco use; promotion of appropriate changes in diet and physical activity; reduction of sun exposure and ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure; facilitation of informed decisions about genetic testing for cancer susceptibility; increases in the uptake of screening for breast, cervix and colorectal cancers; improving the quality of care; and improvements in coping skills and quality of life for cancer survivors and their families. While standard categories of scientific review will be used to evaluate each request, applicants should pay particular attention to the specific review criteria in each of these standard categories, as described below.</p>
		
		<p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
		
		<h4><a name="funds"></a>Funds Available</h4>
		
		<p>The NCI intends to commit approximately $375,000 in FY 2005 to fund from 2-3 administrative supplements in response to this initiative. An applicant may request a project period of 1 year and a budget for direct costs of up to $125,000 per year, excluding Facility and Administrative costs on consortium arrangements (see <a href="http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-04-040.html">NOT-OD-04-040</a>.)  Although the financial plans of the NCI provide support for this program, administrative supplement awards pursuant to this initiative are contingent upon the availability of funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious requests</p>
		 
		 <p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
		 
		 <h4><a name="proc"></a>Application Procedure</h4>
		 
		 <p>P01 and U19 grantees must identify the individual project for which they are seeking supplemental funds. Multiple requests from P01 and U19 grantees are acceptable. However, separate supplement request letters must be submitted for individual components of the parent P01 or U19 grant.</p>
		
		<p>All request letters must include the following:</p>
		<ol type="a">
		  <li>Cover letter:<br>Request the supplement and identify this program.
		  <ul>
		    <li>If applicable, state intent to submit a request for a no-cost extension.</li>
			<li>Include the following statement: &quot;Per supplement instructions, a detailed budget request is enclosed.&quot;</li>
		  </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li>Cover page:
		  <ul>
		    <li>Item 1: The request letter must have the same title as the parent grant. Please include the number of the parent grant.</li>
		    <li>Item 2: Identify as "Administrative Supplement."</li>
		    <li>Item 3: The request letter must have the same PI as the parent grant.</li>
		    <li>Item 4: Request a single year of support. There must be an active parent grant during the entire funding period.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li>Detailed Budget of Initial Budget Period.
		  <ul>
		    <li>All applicants can request up to $125,000 in direct costs per year and must provide a detailed budget.</li>
		  </ul>
		  </li>
		  <li>Research Plan<br>
		  Provide a description of the proposed dissemination and evaluation plan and how it relates to the intervention tested in the parent grant. This description should include an introduction, intervention efficacy data justifying dissemination, relevance to target populations and settings for dissemination, proposed dissemination theory, strategies and methodology (all of the preceding incorporating new findings in the field since the intervention study was completed), procedures to assess dissemination program effectiveness, and plans to sustain effective dissemination approaches once the supplement funding period has ended (not to exceed 12 pages).
		  <ul>
		    <li>Dissemination and evaluation plan needs to be informed by dissemination theories and include process measures tracking dissemination plan components.</li>
			<li>If the parent grant is a U01 or U19 cooperative agreement award, explain how the project will fit within the U01/U19 cooperative agreement terms and conditions of award.</li>
		  </ul><br><br>
		  
		  The following materials should also accompany the request letter:<br>
		  <ol>
		    <li>Intervention program descriptions and products (or copies) must be provided and will be made available for review and inclusion on the <a href="http://rtips.cancer.gov/rtips/index.do">Research-Tested Intervention Programs (RTIPs)</a> Website. Once the request letter is received with the products, the PI will be contacted separately by the National Registry of Effective Programs to review eligibility for inclusion on the RTIPs website.</li>
			<li>Efficacy study publications and/or manuscripts must be provided.</li>
			<li>Include individual biosketches for key personnel.</li>
			<li>Include relevant letters of support from key partner organizations, which may plan to adopt the intervention.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Request letters should contain enough detail to allow assessment of the scientific merit of the proposed dissemination plans and the appropriateness of the request for supplemental funding. Budgets should not exceed $125,000 in direct costs for a time period not exceeding 12 months. All requests require an itemized budget and must be signed by the grantee institution's business office. Requests for administrative supplements under this program must comply with NIH policies for inclusion of women, minorities, and children in research involving human subjects. (See later section for information regarding new policies.)</p>
		
		<p>The earliest anticipated award date for this program will be September 1, 2005. Inquiries related to this notice should be addressed to the NCI Program Director for the particular R01, P01, P50, U01, or U19 for which the supplement is being requested. Applicants are ENCOURAGED to discuss the efficacy data (e.g., effect sizes, consistency with prior research, relevance to target populations) supporting their administrative supplement request from the original project with their respective NCI research project Program Director prior to submission.</p>
		
		<p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

		Dissemination and Diffusion Coordinator<br>
		Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences<br>
		National Cancer Institute<br>
		6130 Executive Blvd., EPN Room 6146<br>
		Bethesda, MD 20892<br>
		Rockville, MD 20852 (for express/courier service)</p>
		
		<p>REQUEST LETTERS HAND-DELIVERED BY INDIVIDUALS TO THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. This policy does not apply to courier deliveries (i.e., FEDEX, UPS, DHL, etc.) (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-02-002.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-02-002.html</a>). This policy is similar to and consistent with the policy for applications addressed to Centers for Scientific Review as published in the NIH Guide Notice at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-012.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-012.html</a>.</p>

		<p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
		
		<h4><a name="rev consid"></a>Review Considerations </h4>
		
		<p>Upon receipt, request letters will be reviewed for completeness and for responsiveness by the NCI. Incomplete and/or non-responsive request letters will not be considered.</p>

		<p>Administrative supplement request letters that are complete and responsive to the supplement announcement will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by NCI program staff (and other appropriate persons and selected outside consultants) who have expertise in the cancer control intervention area and/or dissemination and diffusion research) in accordance with the review criteria stated below. Only those request letters that describe research deemed to have the highest scientific merit will be considered for funding.</p>

		<p><strong>Review Criteria</strong></p>
		
		<p>The goal of NCI-supported dissemination (administrative) supplements is to advance our understanding of effective strategies to encourage dissemination and adoption of evidence-based cancer control interventions. The purpose is to improve the control of disease and enhance health. The staff and consultants will evaluate the following aspects of the administrative supplement requests in order to judge the likelihood that the proposed project will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these goals. Each of these criteria will be addressed and considered by the reviewers, weighting them as appropriate for each request. The administrative supplement request does not need to be strong in all categories in order for it to receive a favorable evaluation. For example, an investigator may propose to carry out important work that, by its nature, is not innovative, but is essential to move a field forward.</p>
		
		<p>The five categories of review criteria to be used in the evaluation of these administrative supplement requests are
 listed below.</p>
 		<ol>
		  <li><strong>Significance</strong>. Do the intervention efficacy data justify dissemination? Does the dissemination of the proposed intervention address an important cancer control problem? If the aims of the proposed project are achieved, how will dissemination and implementation knowledge be advanced? What will be the effect on the concepts or methods that drive this field?</li>
		  <li><strong>Approach</strong>. Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and analyses adequately developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the aims of the intervention that is proposed for dissemination? Has the applicant made appropriate changes in the intervention design based on the current state-of-the-art? Does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternative tactics? Does the applicant demonstrate an understanding of dissemination principles? Is the dissemination approach appropriate to the problem and population? Are the procedures to assess the dissemination program appropriate? Is the evaluation plan linked to the dissemination plan and does the evaluation incorporate the best available data to track dissemination process and impact (within the limits of temporal and budgetary constraints)? How appropriate are the plans to sustain effective dissemination approaches once the supplemental funding period has ended?</li>
		  <li><strong>Innovation</strong>. Does the proposed intervention/dissemination employ novel concepts, approaches, or methods? Are the aims original and innovative? Does the intervention that is proposed for dissemination challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies?</li>
		  <li><strong>Investigator</strong>. Is the investigator appropriately trained and qualified to carry out this work? Does the investigator team include specific dissemination expertise? Relevant letters of support from key partner organizations, which may plan to adopt the intervention, are required.</li>
		  <li><strong>Environment</strong>. Does the environment in which the dissemination work will be done contribute to the
probability of success? Do the proposed approaches take advantage of unique features of the intervention delivery environment or employ useful, collaborative arrangements? Is there evidence of institutional support?</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>To assess the potential for sustainable adoption of the intervention and its use by the target population, the initial review also will examine the request letters for demonstration of the following items: the appropriateness of proposed project budget and duration; and the adequacy of plans to include both genders, minorities and their subgroups, and children as appropriate for the goals of the dissemination plans. Finally, the provisions for the protection of human subjects and the safety of the intervention environment will be examined.</p>

		<p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
		
		<h4><a name="criteria" id="criteria"></a>Award Criteria</h4> 
		
		<p>Request letters for administrative supplements submitted to the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, NCI, will be considered for award based upon the following considerations (a) scientific and technical merit; (b) program relevance; (c) dissemination potential; (d) balance of cancer control topics; and (e) availability of funds. Special consideration will be given to requests that involve plans plan to disseminate interventions tested in low income and ethnically diverse populations.</p>
		
		<p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
		
		<h4><a name="citation"></a>Required Federal Citations</h4>
		
		<p>ALL REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS for PHS grants apply to this administrative supplement including the following:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Human Subjects Protection:</strong><br>
		Federal regulations (45CFR46) require that applications and proposals involving human subjects must be evaluated with reference to the risks to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html</a>).</p>
		
		<p><strong>Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:</strong><br>
		Data and safety monitoring is required for all types of clinical trials, including physiologic toxicity and dose-finding studies (phase I); efficacy studies (Phase II); efficacy, effectiveness and comparative trials (Phase III). Monitoring should be commensurate with risk. The establishment of data and safety monitoring boards (DSMBs) is required for multi-site clinical trials involving interventions that entail potential risks to the participants (NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring, NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts,<br />
		<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html</a>).</p>
		
		<p><strong>Sharing Research Data:</strong><br>
		Investigators submitting an NIH application seeking $500,000 or more in direct costs in any single year are expected to include a plan for data sharing or state why this is not possible<br />
		(<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing</a>).</p>

		<p>Investigators should seek guidance from their institutions, on issues related to institutional policies and local IRB rules, as well as local, State and Federal laws and regulations, including the Privacy Rule. Reviewers will consider the data sharing plan but will not factor the plan into the determination of the scientific merit or the priority score. </p>

		<p><strong>Inclusion of Women And Minorities in Clinical Research:</strong><br>
		It is the policy of the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their sub-populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research projects unless a clear and compelling justification is provided indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43). All investigators proposing clinical research should read the "NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/
		<br />guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html</a>); a complete copy of the updated Guidelines is available at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/	funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm</a>. The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH definition of clinical research; updated racial and ethnic categories in compliance with the new OMB standards; clarification of language governing NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials consistent with the new PHS Form 398; and updated roles and responsibilities of NIH staff and the extramural community. The policy continues to require for all NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials that: a) all applications or proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable; and b) investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic group differences.</p>

		<p><strong>Inclusion of Children as Participants in Clinical Research:</strong><br>
		The NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals under the age of 21) must be included in all clinical research, conducted or supported by the NIH, unless there are scientific and ethical reasons not to include them.</p>

		<p>All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the "NIH Policy and Guidelines" on the inclusion of children as participants in research involving human subjects (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/children/children.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/children/children.htm</a>).</p>
		
		<p><strong>Required Education on the Protection of Human Subject Participants:</strong><br>
		NIH policy requires education on the protection of human subject participants for all investigators submitting NIH applications for research involving human subjects and individuals designated as key personnel. The policy is available at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Public Access to Research Data through the Freedom of Information Act:</strong><br> 
		The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 has been revised to provide public access to research data through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) under some circumstances. Data that are (1) first produced in a project that is supported in whole or in part with Federal funds and (2) cited publicly and officially by a Federal agency in support of an action that has the force and effect of law (i.e., a regulation) may be accessed through FOIA. It is important for applicants to understand the basic scope of this amendment. NIH has provided guidance at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/archive/grants/policy/a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/<br />
		a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm</a>. Applicants may wish to place data collected under this PA in a public archive, which can provide protections for the data and manage the distribution for an indefinite period of time. If so, the application should include a description of the archiving plan in the study design and include information about this in the budget justification section of the application. In addition, applicants should think about how to structure informed consent statements and other human subjects procedures given the potential for wider use of data collected under this award. </p>

		<p><strong>Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information:</strong><br>
		The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) issued final modification to the "Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information", the "Privacy Rule", on August 14, 2002 . The Privacy Rule is a federal regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 that governs the protection of individually identifiable health information, and is administered and enforced by the DHHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR).</p>
		
		<p>Decisions about applicability and implementation of the Privacy Rule reside with the researcher and his/her institution. The OCR website (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/">http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/</a>) provides information on the Privacy Rule, including a complete Regulation Text and a set of decision tools on "Am I a covered entity?" Information on the impact of the HIPAA Privacy Rule on NIH processes involving the review, funding, and progress monitoring of grants, cooperative agreements, and research contracts can be found at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-025.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-025.html</a>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>URLs in NIH Grant Applications or Appendices:</strong><br> 
		All applications and proposals for NIH funding must be self-contained within specified page limitations. Unless otherwise specified in an NIH solicitation, Internet addresses (URLs) should not be used to provide information necessary to the review because reviewers are under no obligation to view the Internet sites. Furthermore, we caution reviewers that their anonymity may be compromised when they directly access an Internet site.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Healthy People 2010:</strong><br>
		The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of "Healthy People 2010," a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This PA is related to one or more of the priority areas. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of "Healthy People 2010" at <a href="http://www.health.gov/healthypeople">http://www.health.gov/healthypeople</a>.</p>
		
		<p align="right"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>
		
		<h4><a name="ar"></a>Authority and Regulations: </h4>
		
		<p>The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and discourage the use of all tobacco products. In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care, or early childhood development services are provided to children. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.</p>
