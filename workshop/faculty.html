            <p>Dr. Jennifer Hay, Associate Attending Psychologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, is a clinical health psychologist and behavioral scientist.  Her primary research interests are in cancer prevention and control, and involve understanding the health behavior change process, particularly uptake and maintenance of cancer screening and sun protection behaviors.  She has an ongoing research program examining cancer risk perception – both how such perceptions are formulated, and how they related to behavioral outcomes.  In her NIH funded work she has examined family communication and health behavior change (screening, sun protection) in families affected by melanoma, has developed and validated a novel method to assess individuals’ intuitive beliefs about their own cancer risk, and is examining the role of cancer risk beliefs in determining adherence to colorectal cancer screening in diverse, multiethnic populations. She is also examining new ways of measuring variation in daily decision-making about sun protection, using state-of-the-art qualitative (ethnographic decision-tree modeling) and quantitative methods (ecological momentary assessment) in populations at risk for melanoma. Dr. Hay is a member of the NCI Physician Data Query (PDQ) Cancer Genetics Editorial Board and the Health Decision-Making Special Interest Group within the Society for Behavioral Medicine.  </p>

			<p><a name="mr"></a><strong>Melissa Riddle, PhD</strong><br />
            Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</p>
            
            <p>Melissa Riddle earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1991. During her time as a UCLA Bruin, Melissa learned behavioral approaches for treating autism, for conducting in-home family therapy, and for data management for community-based studies on HIV risk. Melissa received a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Arizona in 1998. Her doctoral research combined family therapy and health psychology, asking questions related to how patients and their families cope with chronic or serious illness. In 1998, 3 days after defending her dissertation, Melissa started a 2 ½ year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania. During this fellowship, her research and clinical care focused on the psychosocial impact of genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer for women and their families. In 2001, Melissa joined the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, overseeing a grants program on behavioral treatments for drug addiction and HIV risk behavior. She joined the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) in 2007, as chief of a new branch on behavioral and social sciences research. Her vision for the NIDCR program is to support rigorous and relevant oral health research that contributes meaningfully to advancing public health. An essential step in achieving this vision is to integrate health behavior theory into basic and applied behavioral and social sciences research in oral health. The NIDCR is pleased to collaborate on the ATI in Health Behavior Theory, and encourages applications from oral health researchers.</p>

			<p><a name="ar"></a><strong>Alexander Rothman, PhD</strong><br />
            Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota</p>
            			
			<p>Dr. Rothman received his Ph.D. in psychology from Yale University and is currently the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Programs, College of Liberal Arts and a Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Rothman's primary program of research concerns the application of social psychological theory to illness prevention and health promotion and is comprised of a synthesis of basic research on how people process and respond to health information with the development and evaluation of theory-based interventions to promote healthy behavior. He has published a series of articles that examine how people evaluate and process risk-relevant information and has helped to identify the conditions under which people are receptive to information about personal vulnerability. He has also conducted and published several theory-based interventions that test the influence of different forms of persuasive health messages on the performance of a range of health behaviors such as screening mammography and sun screen utilization. In his most recent work, Dr. Rothman has focused on how the relation between people's health beliefs and health behavior unfolds over time. In particular, he has delineated the different decision processes that guide the initiation and maintenance of long-term self-regulatory behavior. In recognition of his work, Dr. Rothman received the 2002 Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology in the area of Health Psychology from the American Psychological Association.</p>
