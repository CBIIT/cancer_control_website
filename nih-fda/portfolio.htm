        <p><strong>Population  Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study</strong><br />
        In October 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a joint national, prospective,  longitudinal cohort study of tobacco users and those at risk for  tobacco-product use to monitor and assess their tobacco use and the resultant  health impacts. The initiative, called the Population Assessment of Tobacco and  Health (PATH) Study, represents the first large-scale NIH-FDA collaboration on  tobacco regulatory research since Congress granted FDA the authority to  regulate tobacco products under the Family Smoking Protection and Tobacco  Control Act (FSPTCA). Scientific experts at the National Institute on Drug  Abuse (NIDA) and FDA&rsquo;s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) will coordinate this  effort via a research contract awarded to Westat in Rockville, MD. </p>
        
        <p>The PATH  Study will prospectively follow almost 60,000 people who are users of tobacco  products and those at risk for tobacco-product use ages 12 and older in the  United States. The study will a) examine what makes people susceptible to  tobacco-product use; b) evaluate initiation and use patterns including use of  new products, dual use, poly use, and switching of tobacco products; c) study  patterns of tobacco-product cessation and relapse ; d) evaluate the effects of  regulatory changes on risk perceptions and other tobacco-related attitudes; and  e) assess differences in attitudes, behaviors, and key health outcomes among  racial/ethnic, gender, and age subgroups. The PATH Study will also collect  biospecimens from adults to analyze biomarkers of tobacco use and disease  processes.</p>
        
        <p>By measuring and  accurately reporting on the social, behavioral and health effects associated  with tobacco-product use in the U.S., the PATH Study will provide an empirical  evidence base to inform the development and assessment of tobacco-product  regulations by the FDA.</p>
