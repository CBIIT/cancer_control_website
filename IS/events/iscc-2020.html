				<p>The 2020 ISCC will be a working meeting that will focus on short-term and long-term cancer control priorities; challenges and opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic; synergies and gaps in the implementation science space across NCI-funded initiatives; and discussion on infrastructures for cross collaboration. The event will feature a variety of presentations and discussion sessions, as well as pre-work prior to encourage more engagement and discussion during each virtual session meeting.</p>      
          <p>The objectives for the ISCC are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Foster communication among those engaged in implementation  science projects across the cancer continuum;</li>
            <li>Identify and develop solutions to common theoretical,  methodological or empirical challenges in implementation science in cancer; and</li>

She studies how to implement and sustain best and promising practices in primary and oncology care to reduce cancer disparities.  She is Chair of the Department of Implementation Science and the Associate Director for Population Science at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her research has been highlighted in the Tobacco Atlas and the Fogarty International Center’s Global Health Matters as a model for translating science into practice and policy to address the global burden of tobacco-induced diseases (R01TW009280; R01TW009280).  Her work was also featured in the Legacy and Partnership for Prevention guide “Help Your Patients Quit Tobacco Use: An Implementation Guide for Community Health Centers” as ‘best practice’ for implementing smoking cessation support in safety net settings in the United States (R21DA024631).  She currently serves as Multiple Principal Investigator of a national, cluster randomized trial to implement evidence-based smoking cessation services within community-based lung cancer screening clinics in 24 sites (1R01CA207158).  She also serves as Multiple Principal Investigator of an NCI P50 grant, “iDAPT: Implementation and Informatics - Developing Adaptable Processes and Technologies for Cancer Control,” one of seven NCI Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control. The goal of iDAPT is to advance the field of implementation science by using technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment and testing of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control (P50CA244693).  Dr. Foley has been awarded grants in primary prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer from the National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Center, the National Science Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  She has built a network of scientists and practitioners who work with community stakeholders to implement, evaluate, and sustain evidence-based cancer prevention and control strategies locally and globally.  She currently serves as Multiple Principal Investigator of an NCI-funded T32 grant, “CAPACiTy:  Cancer Prevention and Control Training Program.”  The goal of the T32 is to train nine postdoctoral fellows in the conduct of cancer prevention in control research with a focus in cancer survivorship, healthy lifestyles, and cancer care delivery.  Dr. Foley was recently awarded the 2019 Wake Forest School of Medicine Mentoring Award at Wake Forest School of Medicine and has been named a 2020-21 ELAM Fellow.  The Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) program is a highly selective and intensive one-year fellowship of leadership training to expand the national pool of qualified women candidates for leadership in academic medicine, dentistry, public health and pharmacy.</p>

At the University of Pennsylvania, she is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the Perelman School of Medicine, a full member of the Abramson Cancer Center, a Senior Fellow of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, Associate Director of the Mixed-Methods Research Lab, and Director of Implementation Science at the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation (PC3I). Her research program broadly aims to improve the quality, value, and delivery of care across the cancer continuum by integrating theoretical and methodological insights from diverse fields. Her work has spanned the cancer control continuum, with substantial focus on cervical, breast, and lung cancer, and published in a variety of scientific journals (including Health Affairs, BMJ Open, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, Qualitative Health Research, and others). Her research has been funded by the National Cancer Institute, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the Lung Cancer Research Foundation, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation. Dr. Rendle completed her undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley, doctoral training at the University of Michigan, and postdoctoral training as a Cancer Prevention Fellow at the National Cancer Institute.
