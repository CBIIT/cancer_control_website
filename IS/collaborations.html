Since 1999, the Comprehensive Cancer Control National Partnership (CCCNP) has come together to support the development and implementation of comprehensive cancer control plans in states, tribes and territories. Phases 1 through 3 of this effort resulted in various tools, guidance documents and technical assistance opportunities, such as the CCC Leadership Institutes. Phases 1-3 were successful in assisting with the development of CCC plans and the implementation of priority planning strategies. Phase 4 of the CCCNP effort is designed to continue the fostering of networks among CCC coalitions and to drive action plans that will result in further implementation of CCC plan priority strategies. The CCCNP has chosen the following priorities for Phase 4: Policy Impacting CCC Efforts; Resources for Implementation of CCC Plans, CCC Implementation at the Local Level; and National Partner Communications.</p>

The first conference was held in 2007 and focused  on &quot;Building the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in the  service of Public Health.&quot; More recent conference topics were around:  &quot;Building Research Capacity to Bridge the  Gap From Science to Service&quot; (2009);  &ldquo;Methods and Measurement&rdquo; (2010); &ldquo;Policy and Practice&rdquo; (2011); and &ldquo;Research at the Crossroads&rdquo; (2012). The goal of the  conference is to promote and encourage the exchange of ideas across the  research community, and to explore contemporary topics and identify concepts,  methods and strategies to build research and organizational capacity for  dissemination and implementation science. The conference provides interactive  forums for the development and growth of the field, with a particular focus on  ways in which research capacity can be enhanced. </p>

                        <p>Several Institutes, Offices and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the National Cancer Institute, have issued a Trans-NIH PAR to encourage investigators, in and outside the U.S., to submit research grant applications that identify, develop, and refine new approaches to test and evaluate models to disseminate and implement research-tested health behavior change interventions and evidence-based services  in public health and clinical practice settings across the cancer continuum. The goals of this program announcement are to encourage trans-disciplinary teams of scientists and practice stakeholders to work together to develop and/or test conceptual models of dissemination and implementation that may be applicable across diverse practice settings, and design studies that will accurately assess the impact of dissemination and implementation efforts on improved services.</p>
