        <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
          <p><strong><u>Scientific/Research</u></strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li id="faq1"><strong>Are methodological approaches other than randomized trials acceptable (e.g., quasi-experimental, qualitative, case studies)?</strong><br />
            Yes. Because the design of a dissemination and implementation research project requires equal attention be paid to the external validity and the internal validity of the strategies being tested, this program announcement encourages consideration of a broad range of methodological approaches. The ones selected should be justified as most appropriate for the specific research question(s) being examined or hypotheses being tested.</li>
          <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>
          <li id="faq2"><strong>How much flexibility do I have in intervention delivery, adapting to my delivery context, versus managing the fidelity of intervention delivery as implemented in the original efficacy/effectiveness trial? </strong><br />
            The impact of a particular intervention will vary both in terms of the fidelity with which the intervention is delivered and the extent to which the intervention is appropriately adapted to fit the service delivery contexts and the characteristics of the population being served.  Applications are encouraged to explicitly address the balance between fidelity (internal validity) and adaptation to improve contextual fit (external validity) in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions.</li>
          <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>
          <li id="faq3"><strong>I have preliminary data on the efficacy of an intervention that is likely to have a very large public health impact in a high priority area. Is it appropriate at this stage to move to a dissemination trial?</strong><br />
            If the preliminary data are so compelling that completion of the efficacy or effectiveness trial is extremely unlikely to change the intervention impact observed, then it may be appropriate to consider submitting. However, this program announcement is designed to expand the knowledge base about how to disseminate and implement interventions that have been rigorously tested and that have been shown to be effective. Thus, the applicant is encouraged to discuss with their NIH institute-specific intervention research project program director the extent to which the preliminary data may justify a dissemination/implementation research project proposal at this time.</li>
          <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>
          <li id="faq4"><strong>My intervention impacts a relatively small (but high risk) population. Is it appropriate for me to submit an application?</strong><br />
            Whether in the public health or clinical practice contexts the population impact of a particular intervention will vary both in terms of the size of the intervention effect and the reach to the population at risk. A small intervention effect applied to a large at risk population may be viewed as similar to a large intervention effect seen for a small but high-risk population. Applications are encouraged that address dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions that impact large underserved populations and/or specific high risk groups.</li>
          <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>
          <li id="faq5"><strong>Does this apply to international populations outside of the U.S., or is this exclusively for study of populations within our borders?</strong><br />
            As noted in the section on eligible institutions, foreign institutions may apply. During the peer review of international studies, the relevance of the study of international populations to US populations often emerges and the applicant should address this relevance in the application when appropriate.</li>
          <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>
          <li id="faq6"><strong>How do I determine whether my team has appropriate expertise and experience to conduct dissemination and implementation research studies?</strong><br />Applicants should assemble a team that has the necessary skills to address the specific aims of the grant.  For dissemination and implementation research studies, this may require multiple streams of expertise, including an understanding of the context in which implementation is intended, the content of the interventions being implemented, and the methods by which the study will be conducted.,  While investigators new to the area are encourage, they are encouraged to explain their qualifications.</li></ol>
          <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>
          <strong><u>Peer Review</u></strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li id="faq7"><strong>Is one peer review group responsible for reviewing all applications?</strong><br />
        Yes. All applications will be reviewed by the Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health standing study section. Information about the study section can be found at:  <a href="http://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/IntegratedReviewGroups/HDMIRG/DIRH/Pages/default.aspx">http://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/IntegratedReviewGroups/HDMIRG/DIRH/Pages/default.aspx</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>
        <p><strong><u>Financial/Grants Management Issues:</u></strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li id="faq8"><strong>How can I determine whether my grant should be submitted as an R03, R21 or R01? </strong><br />The choice of mechanism should relate to the specific question being asked, the scale of the study proposed, and the availability of pilot data to justify a larger scale study.  The R03 intends to facilitate a small, stand-alone study, the R21 enables exploration and development of a larger field of research that will build toward an R01, and the R01 assumes existence of pilot data and readiness to answer research questions in a more definitive way.</li>
          <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>

          <li id="faq9"><strong>Since this is a trans-NIH program announcement, how do I make sure my grant goes to the correct institute?</strong><br />
            Please indicate to which institute or institutes your grant application is most relevant in your cover letter. Wherever possible, you should contact one of the program officials listed on the PAR to ensure that you are indicating an appropriate host Institute.</li>

        <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>

          <li id="faq10"><strong>This PAR encourages collaboration, which could potentially mean several subcontracts and indirect costs. How will the greater cost of collaborative research be weighed in relation to the value of the collaborations themselves?</strong><br />
            As with all NIH grants, indirect costs from collaborative subcontracts do not count towards direct cost ceilings in terms of peer-review requirements (e.g. modular grants &lt; $250,000). The scientific value of the collaborations will be evaluated in peer review with respect to the strengths and limitations of the investigational team within the PI's institution and the complementary expertise added by the collaborative arrangements.</li>

        <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>

          <li id="faq11"><strong>Are matching funds from partner organizations accepted/appropriate?</strong><br />
            Yes. Matching funds from partner organizations are acceptable and appropriate although they are not required. It is often to the applicant's advantage to describe matching funds as it may enhance sustainability of a project beyond the life of the research study.</li>

        <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to Top</a>]</p>

          <li id="faq12"><strong>Can I request permission to exceed $500,000 for direct costs in any year? (R01 only)</strong><br />
            Applicants requesting $500,000 or more in direct costs for any year (excluding consortium F&amp;A costs) must carry out the following steps:<br />
            1) Contact the IC program staff at least 6 weeks before submitting the application, i.e., as plans are being developed for the study;<br />
            2) Obtain agreement from the IC staff that the IC will accept the application for consideration for award; and,<br />
            3) Include a cover letter with the application that identifies the staff member and IC who agreed to accept assignment of the application.</li>
        </ol>
