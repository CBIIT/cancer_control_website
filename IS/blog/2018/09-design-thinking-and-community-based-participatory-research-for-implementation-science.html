				<p><strong>By April Oh</strong></p>
				<p>September  2018</p>
				<p>We need innovation to address our chronic disease burden, and  design thinking has emerged as a promising tool. But as someone who has a  background in community health promotion, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder: how is  design thinking, when applied in community settings to promote community and  population health, different from or similar to community engaged research?</p>
                <p>This question becomes more pertinent with growing interest in  academic-industrial partnerships to advance the impact of our evidence-based  interventions, particularly in behavioral health (Hingle et, al 2018). While  these sorts of partnerships may have had a longer history in engineering,  biomedical science, and technology, with the changing health care, prevention  and technology fields, behavioral science finds itself in a growing marketplace  with opportunity to advance implementation of our work. By leveraging  partnerships with industry and with technology experts in academia, behavioral  scientists may find themselves in a pivotal position to advance population  health goals. (Stey, et al, JAMA, 2018)</p>
              <div style="max-width:360px; float: right; padding-left:1em;">
					<div class="need-help-box">
						<p>As academic and industry partnerships come  together, they will ultimately need to answer the question for what is the  return on investment (ROI)? How can get individuals, communities, systems to  actually use the work we have created and impact behavior change and health?  From an Implementation Science perspective, how can we enhance reach of our  interventions, and better understand the processes for enhancing our  implementation outcomes of interest, adaptation, sustainability, etc.</p>
				  </div> <!-- /.need-help-box -->
				</div>
              <p>As industry and academic partnerships advance, there are two  parallel and overlapping approaches to designing and developing interventions which offer important  perspectives. These two approaches are <em>Human  Centered Design (HCD)</em> from engineering, design, and technology industries  and <em>Community based Participatory Health  Research</em> (CBPR) from public health. Both of these approaches, while from  different fields, offer a place of common ground and orientation and create  opportunities for advancing implementation of behavioral interventions. </p>
                <p>Here are a few definitions: </p>
                <p><strong>Human-centered design (HCD)</strong> is a design and management framework that develops solutions to problems by  involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem-solving process.  Human involvement typically takes place in observing the problem within  context, brainstorming, conceptualizing, developing, and implementing the  solution. </p>
                <p><strong>Community  based participatory research (CBPR)</strong> is a partnership approach to research that equitably involves, for  example, community members,  organizational representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research  process and in which all partners contribute expertise and share decision  making and ownership. The aim of CBPR is to increase knowledge and  understanding of a given phenomenon and integrate the knowledge gained with  interventions and policy and social change to improve the health and quality of  life of community members.</p>
                <p>To kick this off, I sought to compare the two approaches  around some high-level concepts that are relevant for implementation science. There  are many concepts I am leaving out of this table, and certainly if you dig into  the methodologies, many more parallels and differences can be found.</p>

HCD practitioners often view    program adoption as a key area to understand fully before even starting the    research or developing the intervention.</td>
                    <td>Implementation of the intervention may not be the explicit    aim of the research, unless the researcher and community identify it and    mutually agree on this data collection and emphasis. The intervention    developed would also belong to the community. </td>

                </table>
                <p>* I focus on human centered design (versus  user-centered design) because of its empathic approach to the human experience,  which may be more consistent with inherent values for health care applications.</p>
                <p>This table is a high-level comparison, and certainly you can  see many areas of overlap and nuanced similarities and differences.  The two approaches are complimentary, and CBPR  and HCD research and practitioners can work together to learn from each other,  exchange methodologies, and ultimately, enhance our abilities to co-design and  implement investments in evidence-based interventions. Some have argued that  implementation models have not been participatory and do not promote  innovation. Allowing for inclusion of human factors in the design could allow  for better adoption, acceptability and compliance by allowing for faster  iterations (failing early and often) to break social norms, move beyond the  status quo and work &ldquo;in the real world.&rdquo; Community engagement is important for  stakeholder buy in and the research process to reflect the voice, history and  start to balance the power dynamic between researchers and communities, in  particular when addressing health disparities. </p>
                <p>The bottom line is that design thinking for interventions may  be something that our public health CBPR practitioners have been doing, but there  are nuanced differences and the two can inform each other. One way of doing so  may be that community members become part of a design team, or in a research  project, a design approach can be taken in co-development of the intervention  prior to testing and delivery. A HCD approach may borrow from CBPR and consider  including community representatives as part of the design team to develop an  implementation process that recognizes the system in which it will be embedded,  to rapidly experiment, iterate and innovate on solutions. </p>
                <p>Is HCD like CBPR? I think HCD and  CBRP are probably in the same family of approaches. They stress participant's  involvement and producing solutions to problems (although, for CBPR, sometimes  it means, just documenting or studying a problem), stress context, engagement  of the end user on data collection methods and hypotheses. Where the difference  lies is in the rapid cycle iterative emphasis in HCD, the &ldquo;fail fast&rdquo; approach,  typical in innovation spaces, but may be harder to accomplish in a traditional  CBPR methodology. HCD is typically applied in integrating or developing a new  technology or other tools to address health or other social problems, and as a  consequence, perhaps due to the nature of rapid cycle prototyping in technology  fields, it has received greater acceptance from the field for this approach. But  as academic and industry partnership grows, we may be seeing merging  of CBPR and HCD design approaches as  engagement of consumers becomes a core value in health care, while rapid cycle  testing for development will be required to meet the needs and demands of the  marketplace.</p>
              <p>If you are interested in learning  more about how to integrate these two approaches in your work there are a few  opportunities at NCI. The NCI SPRINT program (Speeding Research Tested  Interventions into Practice), encourages participants to take a lean  start up approach to thinking about implementing their research interventions  into practice. The lean start up approach is within the suite of approaches in  design thinking. If you are interested in learning more, and you have an  evidence based intervention, please consider applying to this competitive  program. If you are a mid-career scientist and interested in advancing mhealth   work and thinking about HCD and CBPR consider the Short-term Mentored   Career Enhancement Awards in Mobile and Wireless Health Technology and   Data Analytics: Cross-Training at the intersection of Behavioral and   Social Sciences and STEM Disciplines (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-882.html">PAR-18-882</a>: K18 Independent Clinical Trial Required OR <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-881.html">PAR-18-881</a>: K18 Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed).</p>
                <p>Do you agree? What would you add to this discourse? How can  this be applied to your work as you think about Implementation of your research  into practice?  </p>
