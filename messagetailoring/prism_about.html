		<p><strong><a name="1"></a>What was special about the project?</strong><br>
      The project, &#8220;Promoting Informed Decision Making about Mammography&#8221; was conducted as part of a
	  Cancer Prevention Research Unit funded by the National Cancer Institute. The program was
	  composed of four projects and four cores, which provided shared resources for all the projects.
	  The overarching goal was to advance the field of cancer risk communications by identifying 
      how people perceive cancer-related risks and how those perceptions can be 
      altered to promote informed decisionmaking and behavior change. In PRISM, 
      we tested new ways of communicating concepts related to decisionmaking 
      and breast cancer screening, such as the risk of getting breast cancer, 
      the risk of dying of breast cancer, and the benefits and harms of mammography 
      for women of different ages.</p> 
      <p><strong><a name="2"></a>Why was this project done?</strong><br>
        At project onset, recent controversies about breast cancer screening led 
        to confusion among women and health care providers alike about the age 
        and frequency that women should get mammograms. Some professional organizations 
        recommended that only women aged 50 and older be screened, while others 
        advised that women in their 40s also be screened. The communications model 
        for mammography must change from persuasion or prescription to informed 
        decisionmaking by patients, in collaboration with health care providers. 
        However, informed decisionmaking is easier said than done. This project 
        developed and tested concrete strategies to promote informed decisionmaking 
        about mammography. The lessons learned in this project can be transferred 
        to other areas in which there is uncertainty and patients are advised to 
        make informed decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>What is an informed decision?</strong><br>
	  An informed decision about mammography is made when a woman clearly understands the procedure 
      and recognizes the risks and benefits associated with mammography.  Further she is aware of the 
	  alternatives and is autonomous in making her decision.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="3"></a>What was the overall aim of the project?</strong><br>
        Women receive different and contradictory messages concerning breast cancer 
		risk and appropriate screening practices. Many over- or underestimate 
        their risk for breast cancer as well as the benefits of mammography. Consequently, 
		there is a need to communicate accurate, understandable, and compelling 
        risk messages that alleviate women&#8217;s anxieties about breast cancer 
        risk and motivate them to take appropriate actions.</p>
      <p><strong>Specifically this project intended to help women make informed 
        decisions about mammography by:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Communicating the benefits and harms of mammography for women in 
          their 40s and 50s</li>
        <li>Providing a woman&#8217;s personal risk of getting breast cancer based 
          on the Gail Model and realigning misperceptions about breast cancer 
          risk</li>
        <li>Giving advice to help women overcome their barriers to screening</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We expected to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the accuracy of women&#8217;s personal perceptions about breast 
          cancer risk</li>
        <li> Increase women&#8217;s comprehension of mammography-related information</li>
        <li>Improve women&#8217;s satisfaction with mammography decisions</li>
        <li>Increase the number of women who obtain regular mammograms</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><a name="4"></a>Who participated in the project?</strong><br>
        Approximately 1,300 women members of the Personal Care Plan of Blue Cross 
        and Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC) participated. Women were recruited from 
        a sample that was categorized into two age groups reflecting different 
        decisionmaking issues: 40-44 and 50-54. The sample was stratified on 
        age and mammography adherence status using BCBS claims data. We oversampled 
        women with no record of a mammogram in the past year for women aged 50-54 
        or 2 years for women aged 40-44. Women were randomized in to three groups: 
        Usual Care (UC - standard BCBSNC mammography reminder card mailed on woman's
birthday), Tailored Feedback (Print) (TP), and Tailored Feedback (Print) with Telephone Counseling (TP+TC). 
        They received a baseline telephone survey and 12-month and 24-month follow-up 
        telephone survey (<a href="flowchart.pdf">See PRISM Flowchart</a>.)</p>
      <p><strong><a name="5"></a>How was the project evaluated?</strong><br>
        Baseline data was collected prior to the first intervention. (<a href="Baseline_Survey.pdf">See Baseline 
        Survey</a>) The intervention groups received a tailored booklet with or without 
        telephone counseling. After 12 months, the groups were reassessed with 
        a follow-up interview. (<a href="12-Month_Survey.pdf">See 12-Month Survey</a>) Then, the intervention groups 
        received a tailored newsletter with or without telephone counseling based 
        on the updated data. After 12 months, the groups were again reassessed 
        with a final follow-up interview. (<a href="24-Month_Survey.pdf">See 24-Month Survey</a>) The effectiveness 
        of tailored materials and telephone calls were compared with usual care. 
        It was hypothesized that women who received tailored materials and tailored 
        telephone calls would be more likely to make informed decisions and get 
        regular mammograms than would those who did not receive the tailored materials 
        and/or calls.</p>
      <p><strong>Among the variables we assessed were:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Comprehension of the benefits and harms of mammography </li>
        <li>Accuracy of women&#8217;s perceived personal risk for developing 
          breast cancer</li>
        <li>Intention to get a mammogram</li>
        <li>Adherence to mammography </li>
        <li>Satisfaction with decisionmaking</li>
      </ul>
