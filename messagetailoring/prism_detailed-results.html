<p>At both 12 and 24 month follow-up surveys, women in the TP+TC group were more likely than those in the TP or UC group to know that mammography is more effective for women aged 50-65 (p=0.001). They were also more likely to know that women >50 are at higher risk for breast cancer than those in UC group (p=0.003).  The proportions of those accurate in their breast cancer risk perceptions at both 12 and 24 months were 15% (UC), 16% (TP), and 26% (TP+TC) (p=0.001).  (Table 2)</p>

<p>The 24 month follow-up surveys were conducted before all women had sufficient time to obtain mammograms. As a result, the data were censored. A 12-month window was used to assess mammography use with different assumptions about women who did not have mammograms before the 24 month follow-up survey. At both 12 and 24 months, 18% to 20% of the UC group, 13% to 16% of the TP group, and 22% to 24% of the TP+TC group had mammograms. (Table 3)</p>

<p><strong>Multivariate Results</strong><br>
Table 4 presents the model for the correct answer to the question: "For which age group(s) is mammography most effective?" at both 12-and 24-month follow-ups.
A significant group effect was found for the TP+TC versus UC (OR=3.3, p=0.001). The greatest predictor of correct sustained knowledge (10.9, p<0.001) was having the correct answer at baseline. White women were nearly 3 times more likely than black women to have sustained correct knowledge. Women with at least some college education were 2.3 times more likely to have sustained knowledge than those with less education.</p>

<p>Table 4 also presents the best model for the correct answer to the question: "Who is more likely to get breast cancer?" at both 12- and 24-month follow-ups. Baseline knowledge was again the strongest predictor (OR=12.2, p<0.001). Those in the TP+TC group were 2.3 times more likely than those in the UC group to give correct responses (p<0.001).  White women were 2.4 times more likely to give correct responses than black women (p=0.022). Also, women with at least some college education were almost twice as likely than those with less education (p=0.023), and women in their 40s were 1.5 times more likely than those in their 50s to give correct responses at both follow-ups (p=0.043).</p>

<p>Results from our analysis examining the best model to predict accurate breast cancer risk perception at 12 and 24 months is shown in Table 4. Being accurate at baseline survey (OR=7.0, p<0.001); being in the TP+TC group (OR=2.1, p<0.001); and being in their 40s (OR=1.6, p<0.001) were the significant variables.</p>

<p>Also shown in Table 4 is the probability of having had mammograms after the 12- and 24-month follow-up surveys where we use the 12-month window. The TP+TC group was 40% more likely to have had mammograms than the UC group (OR=1.4, p=0.283). The TP group was 30% less likely to have had mammograms than the UC group (OR=0.7, p=0.059). Those stating that mammograms give them "a feeling of control" over their health and who disagreed with the statement "Once you have a couple of normal mammograms, you do not need any more for a few years" were 2.5 times more likely to have sustained adherence than those in other categories (p=0.015). Women in their 50s were 2.4 times more likely than those in their 40s to have had mammograms at both 12 and 24 months (p<0.001). Similar results were observed when using the 15-month window to assess mammography use, with the exception of comparative risk (data not shown). </p>
