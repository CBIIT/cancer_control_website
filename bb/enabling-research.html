        	<h1>Enabling the Cancer Control Research Community</h1>
            <p>The sources of our greatest advances in cancer control are difficult to predict and typically emerge from the talented investigators in our funded research community. Often, their rich experimental ideas can only be realized with NCI funding support and free and open access to the robust, high-quality data and sophisticated research tools that DCCPS provides. By gathering, synthesizing, and making massive amounts of scientific information readily available, using the latest technology, DCCPS affords opportunities to our research community they otherwise would not have.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box"><div class="dingbat"><img src="images/quote-dingbat.png" alt="small multi-colored image"></div><div class="quote">Often, [the research community’s] rich experimental ideas can only be realized with NCI funding support and free and open access to the robust, high-quality data and sophisticated research tools that DCCPS provides.</div></div>
            
            <p>Here we list a few examples of some of the large-scale, sophisticated efforts led by DCCPS that ensure that researchers, public health practitioners, and policy makers have the resources they need to make large leaps in the complex and national effort to control cancer.</p>
            
            <h2>Team Science Toolkit</h2>
            <p>Cancer researchers are asking highly sophisticated questions and proposing multifaceted scientific initiatives that require a team approach that incorporates expertise of many individuals from different scientific backgrounds. The <a href="https://www.teamsciencetoolkit.cancer.gov/Public/Home.aspx">Team Science Toolkit</a>, developed by DCCPS experts, includes nearly 1,000 resources to help users engage in, manage, facilitate, support, or evaluate team-based collaboration in science. The Toolkit is an interactive website that consolidates knowledge in the Science of Team Science (SciTS) field and facilitates resource sharing and information exchange among the broad community of stakeholders interested in team science.</p> 
            
            <h2>NCI GeoViewer</h2>
            <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/NCI-GEOViewer.png" alt="NCI GeoViewer"></div>
            <p>In 2014, DCCPS launched <a href="https://gis.cancer.gov/geoviewer/">NCI GeoViewer</a>, the latest addition to the publicly available geospatial tools on <a href="http://gis.cancer.gov">GIS.cancer.gov</a> for cancer surveillance and population-based cancer research. Geovisualization helps identify areas for greater epidemiologic investigation and as targets for interventions. With NCI GeoViewer, users can create maps of cancer statistics, demographics, and risk factors, with access to five sets of high-quality <a href="https://gis.cancer.gov/geoviewer/data/">statistics</a>: demographics, cancer incidence, cancer mortality, cancer prevalence, and screening and risk factors. Users are able to select the type of statistic and by-variables shown on the map, change the colors and groups of mapped statistics by choosing from a variety of map options, and extract the map by printing or saving an image or downloading the statistics in a delimited format for further analyses in other software.</p>
            
            <h2>Health Disparities Calculator (HD*Calc) </h2>
            <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/SEER.png" alt="SEER"></div>
            <p><a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/hdcalc/">HD*Calc</a> is designed to generate multiple summary measures to evaluate and monitor health disparities. The HD*Calc statistical software can be used either as an extension of <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/">SEER*Stat</a> — allowing users to import <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov">SEER</a> data — or with other population-based health data. HD*Calc was originally developed to expand the range of measures for evaluating health disparities related to cancer. However, because it can be used with any dataset, HD*Calc can be used in any research arena. Cross-sectional and trend data (e.g., cancer rates, survival, stage at diagnosis) categorized by disparity groups (e.g., area-socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, geographic areas) can be imported into HD*Calc to generate four absolute and seven relative summary measures of disparity. The results are displayed as tables and charts, which may be exported for use in other applications. The latest version of HD*Calc was released in FY 2014.</p>
            
            <h2>State Cancer Profiles </h2>
            <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/planet.png" alt="Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. Plan, Link, Act, Network with Evidence-based Tools"></div>
            <p>A part of <a href="http://cancercontrolplanet.cancer.gov">Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T.,</a> <a href="http://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov">State Cancer Profiles</a> is a comprehensive system of interactive maps and graphs enabling the investigation of cancer trends at national, state, and county levels. The goal of the site is to provide a system to characterize the cancer burden in a standardized manner in order to motivate action, integrate surveillance into cancer control planning, characterize areas and demographic groups, and expose health disparities. It is a collaboration between NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In FY 2014, State Cancer Profiles was redesigned to better serve cancer control planners, public health officials, researchers, and the general public interested in profiling cancer in order to meet the common goal of reducing the cancer burden. The newly redesigned website features a Cancer Control Continuum Dashboard as a point of access to cancer-related statistics that range from prevention to survival. Another important new access point on the home page is a clickable US map that provides a quick reference to the same cancer-related statistics across the geospatial continuum. In addition, the site offers more user-friendly interactive mapping capabilities, charts, and graphs that, all together, contribute to better understanding of cancer-related data over space and time. This release includes NCI SEER and CDC National Program of Cancer Registries incidence data through 2011, screening and risk factor data, and demographic data.</p>
            
            <h2>Cancer Trends Progress Report</h2> 
            <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/healthypeople.png" alt="Healthy People 2020"></div>
            <p>One of NCI’s important responsibilities is communicating our nation’s progress against cancer to the public. The <a href="http://progressreport.cancer.gov"><i>Cancer Trends Progress Report</i></a> is a significant part of that dissemination process. First issued by DCCPS in 2001, the report summarizes our nation’s progress against cancer in relation to <a href="http://www.healthypeople.gov"><i>Healthy People</i></a> targets set forth by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The report draws on data from numerous federal departments and agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and several offices and agencies within HHS, including the CDC, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The content, design, and production of the report are the results of a collaboration among federal and state agency partners, consumer advocates, the American Cancer Society, and others. Available only online, the report can be printed in part or in its entirety. Portions of the report are updated annually, while other sections are updated as new data become available. The latest release of the full report was updated in 2014 and will be released in early 2015.</p>
            
            <h2>Cancer Prevalence and Cost of Care Projections</h2> 
            <p>DCCPS conducts cutting-edge research on the economic burden of cancer and employs some of the nation’s top health economists. The division examines the determinants of the cost of cancer care and develops estimates of the overall economic burden of cancer. To prepare this information, DCCPS has worked to develop new methods and is using the most recent data to estimate the cost of cancer care and to provide projections of cost of care in the future based on population trends. This information has important policy implications for health care planning and resource allocation. On the DCCPS <a href="http://costprojections.cancer.gov">Cancer Prevalence and Cost of Care Projections website</a>, visitors can see cost of care or prevalence by cancer site, sex, age, and year under various assumptions. Cancer prevalence is estimated and projected by tumor site through 2020 using incidence and survival data from the SEER Program and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Annualized net costs of care were estimated using Medicare claims linked to SEER data and adjusted to represent costs in 2010 US dollars. The site is based on a DCCPS study that estimates and projects the national cost of cancer care through the year 2020 separately for multiple cancer sites using the most recent available US population projections, cancer incidence, survival, and cost of care data.</p>
            <div class="center-block"><img src="images/cancer-cost-projections.png" alt="Cost of Cancer Care by Phase of care, All Sites, All Ages, Male and Female, in 2010 Dollars."></div>
             
            
            <h2>Health Information National Trends Survey</h2>
            <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/hints.png" alt="Health Information National Trends Survey. HINTS"></div>
            <p>The <a href="http://hints.cancer.gov">Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)</a> is a nationally representative, biennial telephone survey of 8,000 randomly selected adults. NCI and extramural communication researchers are analyzing the data to gain insight into people’s knowledge about cancer, the communication channels through which they obtain health information, and their cancer-related behaviors. Program planners are using the data to overcome barriers to health information usage across populations, and obtaining the data they need to create more effective communication strategies. Finally, social scientists are using the data to refine their theories of health communication in the information age and to offer new and better recommendations for reducing the burden of cancer throughout the population. As of FY 2014, 170 publications had used data from HINTS, which released new data in 2014 for free download.</p> 
            
            <h2>Cancer Survivor Prevalence Data</h2>
            <p>To better understand the demographics of the US population of cancer survivors, the division’s Office of Cancer Survivorship and the Surveillance Research Program worked together to develop survivorship prevalence estimates based on the SEER registry database, which represents five states (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah) and four standard metropolitan statistical areas (Detroit, Atlanta, San Francisco-Oakland, and Seattle-Puget Sound). <a href="/ocs/statistics/statistics.html">Cancer survivor prevalence data</a> published in FY 2014 by DCCPS and colleagues at the American Cancer Society indicates a current figure of 14.5 million survivors and projects the number of cancer survivors to increase by 31%, to almost 19 million, by 2024. </p>
            <div class="center-block"><img src="images/cancer-survivors.png" alt="Estimated Number of US Cancer Survivors by Sex and Years Since Diagnosis (as of January 1, 2014)"></div>
            
            <h2>The Cancer Genomics and Epidemiology Navigator (CGEN)</h2>
            <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/CGEN.png" alt="The Cancer Genomics and Epidemiology Navigator (CGEN)"></div>
            <p><a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/cgen/">CGEN</a> is a searchable knowledge base, providing regularly updated linked information on NCI-funded cancer epidemiology and genomics research grants, peer-reviewed publications, and evidence-based cancer genomic tests. CGEN collates information derived from multiple sources into a centralized search engine to assess the impact of genomic, environmental, and clinical factors on cancer occurrence and outcomes. Ultimately, CGEN serves as a tool to accelerate cancer epidemiologic research. The EGRP in DCCPS recently launched this online resource in response to the concerns of researchers and grantees who reported having difficulty finding information about funded research and publications specific to cancer epidemiology and genomics. Filtering options (e.g., by cancer site, by risk factors, by authorship) allow users to fine-tune searches. For example, researchers can use the “Search CGEN” tool to find broad-based information on a particular risk factor (e.g., smoking); explore EGRP active grants to identify gaps in the EGRP-supported grant portfolio that could guide a research agenda; peruse publications to find peer-reviewed articles that have resulted from currently funded EGRP grants; identify potential collaborations with experts in a particular area, by filtering the list of principal investigators by their links to active or inactive grants and cancer sites; and find an NCI study section for a proposed application by searching for past and current grants with similar features.</p>

            <h2>SEER-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey Linked Database</h2>
            <p>The <a href="http://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/seer-mhos/">SEER-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS)</a> linked database is a unique resource that can be used to improve understanding of the health-related quality of life of cancer patients and survivors enrolled in Medicare Advantage health plans. The database contains clinical, quality-of-life, socioeconomic, demographic, and other information, and is the result of the linkage of two large population-based data sources: SEER cancer registries data and Medicare enrollment and claims files. The database is sponsored by NCI and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and has been publicly available to external investigators since 2010. With recent additions, the SEER-MHOS database now contains MHOS surveys from more than one and a half million beneficiaries, with over 82,000 linked to the SEER cancer registry. As of FY 2014, approximately 1,000 publications have used SEER-Medicare data, with topics spanning the continuum of cancer control activities, including diagnosis/treatment, survivorship, second occurrence, and end of life. (A <a href="http://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/seermedicare/overview/publications.html">complete list of publications</a> can be found at the SEER-Medicare website.)</p>
            
            <h2>Genetic Simulation Resources</h2>
            <p>Genetic simulations play an important role in genetic research, specifically for the development and testing of analytic methods and assisting with the interpretation of results. Numerous simulation programs have been written for a variety of applications; however, choosing the right tool for a particular study can prove challenging. To this end, the <a href="http://popmodels.cancercontrol.cancer.gov/gsr/">Genetic Simulation Resources (GSR)</a> catalogue was created by DCCPS. The purpose of the GSR is to help investigators identify the genetic simulator most suitable for their research needs. The <a href="http://popmodels.cancercontrol.cancer.gov/gsr/">GSR website</a> includes more than 90 existing software packages that were identified based on publications in relevant scientific journals. The site provides basic information about these applications, such as descriptions, release dates, and links to web pages for the simulation programs. In addition, the GSR characterizes applications by many different attributes, including simulation method, type of genetic variation, input/output formats, programming languages, and license information. Users are able to search and compare simulation software on the GSR website according to these attributes so that they can quickly identify the most appropriate software application for their study.</p>
                        <aside class="sidebar"><h2>Opportunities for Researchers</h2>
            <p>In addition to encouraging the best scientific ideas for researchers through investigator-initiated applications and omnibus solicitations, DCCPS develops and participates in NIH funding opportunities aimed at stimulating new directions in specific research to examine, discover, and test methodologies to improve public health.
