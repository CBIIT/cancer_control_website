                    <p>NIH has supported behavioral medicine research for 40 years through funded research, conferences, priority setting, and training programs. Over those four decades, behavioral medicine research has played a critical role in responding to major public health challenges, including, most notably, the HIV/ AIDS crisis and tobacco control and prevention.</p>
                    <p>Research on tobacco use is regarded as one of the most significant public health success stories, and NCI&mdash;along with the NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)&mdash;has been particularly involved in funding groundbreaking tobacco control research over the decades, as well as supporting the development of evidence-based interventions, ranging from smoking cessation interventions to environmental changes and policies shown to prevent smoking and tobacco use (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825087">Czajkowski et al., J Behav Med, 2019</a>).</p>

                    <p>At NCI, DCCPS was established in 1997 and included the Behavioral Research Program (BRP) as one of its major programmatic areas. Creating a program specifically focused on behavioral research in cancer control reflected the understanding that what was once a niche area of research had evolved to become a respected and essential part of scientific research, now integrated into virtually every aspect of the cancer control continuum, from prevention to end-of-life care. In the two decades since the establishment of the DCCPS BRP, the division has taken a leadership role on such NIH-level behavioral research efforts as the NIH Obesity Task Force, NIH Common Fund Programs with a behavioral research component, and international tobacco control research. The BRP grant portfolio at NCI has grown steadily, including 244 grants in FY 2018 compared with 186 in FY 1998. Behavioral research informs virtually all research conducted in the division&rsquo;s other programs, including smoking and lung cancer modeling, epidemiology cohorts, patient-centered communication, clinical trial enrollment, and behavioral barriers to implementing evidenced-based interventions.</p>

                    <h3>Cancer and Aging </h3>
					<p>As the US population ages, the number of cancer survivors will continue to increase exponentially. DCCPS is committed to developing a robust area of research to investigate the intersection between cancer and aging, with the goal of improved understanding about the short- and long-term effects of cancer and its treatment on aging trajectories among pediatric and adult cancer survivor populations. The <a href="/brp/bbpsb/aging-trajectories.html">Cancer and Accelerated Aging: Advancing Research for Healthier Survivors</a> initiative represents a collaboration of NCI, the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and representatives from cancer research institutions throughout the country. It seeks to identify scientific research needs related to the aging consequences of cancer and cancer treatment and to build a transdisciplinary research portfolio to optimize healthy aging for cancer survivors. The initiative held two think tank meetings with experts in the field to determine how best to 1) measure aging and identify aging phenotypes in cancer survivors, and 2) identify strategies to prevent or remediate cancer- and treatment-associated aging (Guida et al., J Natl Cancer Inst, 2019; Guida et al., J Geriatr Oncol, 2019, in press). In addition, DCCPS established the Perspectives on Cancer and Aging: Arti Hurria Memorial Webinar Series as a platform to broadly disseminate the work of researchers
					  dedicated to cancer and aging research. This quarterly series is dedicated to the legacy of Dr. Hurria, a BRP grantee and collaborator and pioneer in the fields of geriatrics and oncology. In addition, DCCPS staff were the initial facilitators of the Trans-NCI Cancer and Aging Coordinating Committee (CACC) to integrate and coordinate all NCI cancer and aging extramural program activities, and to facilitate extramural program interactions and collaborations with NIA and the Trans- NIH GeroScience Interest Group.</p>
					<h3>Communication of Genetic Information</h3>
					<p>Recent advances in genetic and genomic technologies have revolutionized our ability to prevent, detect,
					  and treat cancer, adding increasing complexity to patient-clinician communication and patient
					  engagement in research. Based on the Blue Ribbon Panel&rsquo;s recommendations to advance the goals of the Cancer MoonshotSM, NCI established several initiatives to address those recommendations. Two initiatives related to the communication of genetic information were 1) <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/hereditary-cancers">Prevention and Early Detection of Hereditary Cancers</a> and 2) <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/patient-engagement">Establish a Network for Direct Patient Engagement</a>. As part of these initiatives, DCCPS issued multiple funding opportunities. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-ca-19-001.html">Communication and Decision Making for Individuals with Inherited Cancer Syndromes</a> is a request for applications (RFA) to develop, test, and evaluate interventions and implementation approaches, or adapt existing approaches, to improve patient/provider/family risk communication and decision making for individuals and families with an inherited susceptibility to cancer so that they can make informed clinical risk 
					  management decisions. Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-19-045.html">RFA-CA-19-045</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-19-046.html">RFA-CA-19-046</a>) is a set of RFAs to support the 
					  PE-CGS Network, which will include several research centers and a coordinating center. The purpose of the network is two-fold: It will promote and support research on direct engagement of cancer patients and posttreatment cancer survivors as participants in cancer research, and it will use such approaches for rigorous cancer genome sequencing projects addressing important knowledge gaps in the genomic characterizations of tumors in areas such as rare cancers, highly lethal cancers, cancers with early age of onset, cancers with high disparities, and cancers in understudied populations. Additionally, BRP commissioned a scoping review of recent published literature on communication of cancer-related genetic and genomic testing information, which identified areas of strong research emphasis and also revealed gaps ripe for further research (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573799">Kaphingst et al., Genet Med, 2019</a>).</p>
					<h3>Alcohol and Cancer</h3>
					<p>Alcohol is a well-established human carcinogen, and mounting evidence points to a link  between  alcohol and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, colon/rectum, esophagus, liver, stomach, and female breast. There is also some evidence that alcohol may increase the risk of lung, pancreatic, and skin cancers. Additionally, alcohol use can have detrimental effects on cancer treatment, leading to prolonged recovery, increased surgical procedures, higher health care costs, and more. Although momentum is building to better address alcohol consumption in cancer prevention and control, at least half of both Americans and the global population do not consider alcohol a risk factor for cancer. DCCPS seeks to engage the research community on challenges related to communication and awareness, alcohol drinking and outcomes in cancer patients and survivors, and mechanisms linking alcohol and cancer. Activities to advance interest in this research area include presentations at national and international scientific conferences and development of several publications about awareness of the link between alcohol consumption and cancer (e.g., Klien et al., JAMA, in press, 2019). In September 2018, DCCPS hosted a webinar, &ldquo;Alcohol and Cancer in the United States,&rdquo; featuring Noelle K. LoConte, MD, lead author of the Alcohol and Cancer statement by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, published in November 2017.</p>
					<h3>Sleep</h3>
					<p>The role of sleep in cancer prevention and control is an important but understudied topic. Possible mechanisms linking sleep and cancer include immune functioning and inflammatory processes, which can be modulated by sleep quality, timing, and duration. Research also suggests that the psychological and cognitive sequalae of poor sleep may influence decisions across the cancer continuum, from decisions to engage in unhealthy behaviors that may increase cancer risk (e.g., low physical activity, poor diet, and alcohol consumption) to decisions about treatment, palliative care, information sharing, and genetic testing.</p>
					<p> DCCPS has identified sleep quality and chronotype (i.e., morning vs. evening types) as important areas for further understanding, especially in relation to their influence on addiction and tobacco use among other co-occurring behaviors. We seek to further understand the state of sleep research as it relates to cancer prevention and control, enhance our understanding 
					  of the relationship between sleep and cancer, as well as support the development and implementation of cancer prevention and control interventions for healthy populations and cancer patients and survivors.</p>
					<h3><strong>Geospatial Research</strong></h3>
					<p>The growth of geographic information science and the application of geospatial tools and data visualization techniques have advanced our understanding of cancer prevalence, etiology, and treatment. In addition, there is greater recognition that a multilevel approach is needed to address the complex nature of cancer. Progress in this area and its importance in enhancing cancer control efforts at the community level resulted   in a <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/events/geospatial/">2016 NCI-sponsored conference on Geospatial Approaches to Cancer Control and Population Sciences</a>, attended by almost 300 investigators. The conference led to the development of a focus issue of the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, titled &ldquo;<a href="https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/26/4#CEBPFocusGeospatialApproachestoCancerControlandPopulationSciences" class="external-link">CEBP Focus: Geospatial Approaches to Cancer Control and Population Sciences</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>.&rdquo; Moreover, a recent review of publications arising from NCI-Designated Cancer Centers indicates a rapid increase in the number of papers involving geospatial approaches, especially since 2000 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423759">Korycinski et al., Cancer Causes Control, 2018</a>). Recently, DCCPS issued administrative supplements for geospatial, multilevel, and contextual approaches in cancer control and population sciences (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-19-029.html">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-19-029.html</a>).</p>
					<h4>Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (e.g., e-cigarettes)</h4>
					<p>With the proliferation of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) (such as e-cigarettes and other vaping devices) in the marketplace and a rise in youth e-cigarette use to epidemic levels, research is critically needed to answer many important questions about these products and the public health implications of their use. Specifically, we need to better understand how to monitor the rapidly evolving marketplace of these and other tobacco products. Regarding health effects, we need more research on the short- and long-term health effects of ENDS and patterns of use among youth and adults over time, especially their use in combination with other tobacco products. To better understand and address the public health challenge presented by youth ENDS use, we need research about the determinants of use, particularly risk and protective factors, and how youth smoking prevention and cessation research may inform the development of interventions to reduce youth ENDS use.</p>
					<p>DCCPS encourages research on the effects of ENDS on individual and population health through participation in two trans-NIH PARs (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-845.html">PAR-18-845</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-18-847.html">PAR-18-847</a>) and through several Tobacco Regulatory Science Program (TRSP) funding announcements. In addition, investigators may submit ENDS-related research proposals through the omnibus announcements. Currently, NCI is funding 
					  40 grants with a primary or secondary focus on ENDS research. These projects investigate a broad range 
					  of topics, including ENDS toxicity and health impact, perceptions of ENDS&rsquo; risks and harms, ENDS use by adolescents and young adults, the influence of ENDS on other tobacco-use behaviors, and the impact of ENDS product marketing and promotion. Several grants focus on understanding trajectories of ENDS use over time, especially concurrent and multiple tobacco product use (dual or polyuse). Other important areas 
					  of study include contextual factors that influence ENDS use, such as promotion of ENDS through social media and the impact of tobacco control policies. In 2018, DCCPS co-sponsored and co-led an NIH-FDA workshop on ENDS Measurement, which focused on identifying gaps and developing a consensus on measures for ENDS device characteristics and ENDS use behavior.</p>
					<h3>Social Media</h3>
					<p>The Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch within BRP has spearheaded many NIH efforts to study changing patterns of health information exchange brought on by technology and new media. Through funding opportunity  announcements such as Innovative Approaches to Studying Cancer Communication in the New Media Environment (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-18-638.html">PAR-18-638</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-639.html">PAR-18-639</a>) and Using Social Media to Understand and Address Substance Use and Addiction (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-14-008.html">RFA-CA-14-008</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-14-009.html">RFA-CA-14-009</a>), DCCPS is advancing 
					  the science and methodology in this emerging field and its impact on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.</p>
					<p>As social media becomes more ubiquitous as a source of information, we are seeing the rise of inaccurate or false health information on social media platforms. This dynamic is occurring in an era of low trust in social institutions, including the medical system. This confluence of factors&mdash;pervasive social media, rampant misinformation, and lack of trust in expert sources&mdash;is creating new challenges in effectively communicating evidence-based information to patients and the general public. DCCPS is interested in supporting innovative and multidisciplinary research in this area. In August 2018, it held a <a href="/brp/hcirb/misinformation.html">working group meeting</a> to develop a research agenda for understanding and addressing cancer-related misinformation on social media platforms, and that meeting has resulted in several publications. DCCPS also will publish a special issue about health misinformation on social media, in collaboration with the American Journal of Public Health.</p>
					<h3>Data Integration</h3>
					<p>Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) methods can be used to study cancer control and behavioral risk factors for cancer, including tobacco and alcohol use, diet and physical activity, UV and environmental exposures, sleep, and medical adherence to screening and vaccine uptake. By merging multiple iterations of survey, cohort, or experimental data, or linking data by matching entity (e.g., person, hospital, school) or geocodes (e.g., zip code, county or state, or another geographic identifier), IDA-related research can yield efficient and productive research that reduces costs, bridges behavioral research with other disciplines, and enhances longitudinal analyses and assessment of small populations. Recently, DCCPS issued administrative supplements for IDA to extend research to answer novel cancer prevention and control questions (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-18-087.html">https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-18-087.html</a>).</p>

                    <h2>Behavioral Research to Inform and Respond to Public Policy</h2>
                    <p>DCCPS supports science that helps to inform policies and programs aimed at preventing, detecting, and treating cancer. The division&rsquo;s long-standing history of collaborating across the NIH and other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as other agencies, makes it uniquely suited to support research that provides policy makers with the practical evidence they need to shape and respond effectively to national cancer-related efforts.</p>          
                    <div class="subsection-img">
                        <img src="/bb/images/behavioral-research-inform-and-respond-public-policy.jpg" class="img-fluid clipout2" alt="Photo of a group of professionals sitting at a table.">
                    </div>
					  <p>This section provides examples of the division&rsquo;s behavioral research contributions related to public policy, illustrating its vital role in developing a comprehensive base of scientific evidence for policy makers and public health practitioners.</p> 
                    <h3>Tobacco Control</h3>
					<p>NCI&rsquo;s Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB), within BRP, leads and collaborates on research and disseminates evidence-based findings to prevent, 
					 treat, and control tobacco use in order to create a world free of tobacco use and related cancer and suffering. DCCPS&rsquo; work informs numerous areas of tobacco control-related policy; included here are just a  few examples.</p>
					<ul class="inline-links">
					  <li>DCCPS-supported research shows that significantly increasing the excise tax and price of tobacco products is the  single  most  consistently  effective tool for reducing tobacco use (Monograph 21).</li>
					  <li>A current TCRB-led funding opportunity, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-675.html#_Section_VII._Agency">US Tobacco Control Policies to Reduce Health Disparities</a>, supports projects that address cancer health disparities in tobacco use in the 
						United States.</li>
					  <li>The NCI-sponsored <a href="/brp/tcrb/tus-cps/">Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey</a> (TUS-CPS) is conducted every 3 to 4 years as part of the US 
						Census Bureau&rsquo;s CPS. The TUS-CPS serves as a key source of national- and state-level data on tobacco use behavior, attitudes, and policies in the United States. (See page 8.)</li>
					  <li>DCCPS-funded research has contributed to the strong evidence base regarding effective treatments and interventions for tobacco dependence. This research informs CMS as it 
						develops policies regarding smoking cessation as a covered benefit among recipients of Medicare and Medicaid, and the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program continues to offer smoking cessation programs and medications to its 
						beneficiaries without co-payments or coinsurance.</li>
					  <li>NCI collaborated with the World Health Organization on <a href="/brp/tcrb/monographs/21/">Monograph 21: The Economics of Tobacco and Tobacco Control</a>. The monograph examines the current research and evidence regarding the economics of tobacco control and has helped to direct future research and inform tobacco prevention and control programs and policies around the world.</li>
					  <li>The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granted FDA the authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products in order to protect public health. Within the framework of the Tobacco Control Act, the NIH and FDA formed the <a href="https://prevention.nih.gov/tobacco-regulatory-research">Tobacco Regulatory Science Program</a> (TRSP) partnership to establish 
						a comprehensive research agenda in tobacco regulatory science.</li>
					  <li>The <a href="/brp/tcrb/sctc.html">State and Community Tobacco Control</a> (SCTC) Research Initiative was developed to increase collaboration among researchers and practitioners and to promote innovative research that benefits state and community tobacco control efforts. 
						SCTC supported studies that addressed important understudied aspects of tobacco use and exposure in the United States while also examining the effectiveness of state and community tobacco control policy and media interventions.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>A Healthier Generation</h3>
					<p>Evidence continues to show that lifestyle behaviors such as diet, physical activity, obesity/overweight, and energy balance can influence the chance of developing cancer, even after accounting for other factors such 
					 as stress, environment, or smoking. DCCPS works with numerous federal and non-federal partners to help set national objectives for promoting health and preventing disease. The division also supports 
					 individual and community-based intervention research that explores the effect of lifestyle behaviors in order to help inform ongoing public health efforts across the US and the world.</p>
					<p>DCCPS co-leads the Healthy People 2020 Cancer Chapter Workgroup with CDC. The Healthy People 2020 initiative provides science-based, 10-year national objectives for promoting health and preventing disease. DCCPS&rsquo; Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)&mdash;nationally representative data routinely collected about the American public&rsquo;s use of cancer-related information&mdash;is used to evaluate the success of Healthy People goals.</p>
					<p>DCCPS also has helped to inform the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs), which are jointly issued and updated every 5 years by USDA and HHS. The guidelines form the basis for federal nutrition policy and provide authoritative dietary advice to promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases. DCCPS-supported researchers developed methodologies for estimating usual dietary intake distributions and identifying sources of key dietary constituents including added sugars, and the resulting data have proven to be critical for the recent and upcoming versions of the guidelines.</p>
					<p>In addition, DCCPS worked with researchers at USDA to develop the <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/hei/">Healthy Eating Index</a> (HEI), a measure of dietary quality, which assesses conformance to the DGAs and has been used in hundreds of studies, including the evaluation of USDA&rsquo;s multi-billion- 
					 dollar food assistance programs. The division also has supported the 2007 <a href="/brp/hbrb/fab/">Food Attitude and Behaviors (FAB) Survey</a> and, since 2003, the <a href="https://class.cancer.gov/">Classification of Laws Associated with School Students</a>, which provides an empirical and regularly updated scoring system used by researchers, policy makers, and the public to evaluate and track changes in state laws related to 
					 school nutrition.</p>
					<p>DCCPS also funds a number of research initiatives that focus on enhancing the research base for physical activity and its effects on cancer, including mechanisms of physical activity behavior change, physical activity in women with infants, and the protective effects of physical activity on adolescent tobacco use prevention. In addition, DCCPS is leading efforts to examine the role of physical activity in modulating cancer recurrence and survival outcomes through its mechanisms, initiatives, and support of a 
					 clinical trial to test the hypothesis that reducing obesity will increase survival time.</p>
					<p>DCCPS&rsquo; work also helps to inform the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which describe the types and amounts of physical activity that offer substantial health benefits. The guidelines serve as the primary, authoritative voice of the federal government for evidence-based guidance on physical activity, fitness, and health. The <a href="https://health.gov/paguidelines/second-edition/">second edition of the guidelines</a> was released in 2018.</p>
					<p>The DCCPS-supported <a href="/brp/hbrb/trec/index.html">Transdisciplinary Research</a><a href="/brp/hbrb/trec/index.html"> on Energetics and Cancer (TREC)</a> initiative fostered transdisciplinary research to elucidate underlying biological mechanisms of obesity and cancer, explore new biomarkers, develop potential for genetics/ genomics to advance individualized treatment, expand translational research focus, add particular 
					 emphasis on cancer survivors, and strengthen use and integration of theoretical constructs.</p>
					<p>DCCPS also supports evaluation research of programs and time-sensitive policies that affect diet, physical activity, and weight at the population level. The funded grants have covered a wide range of policies, such 
					 as examining the effects of the built environment on physical activity and evaluating whether the 
					 development of supermarket or food hubs will improve eating and shopping behaviors.</p>
					<h3>Health Equity</h3>
					<p>Achieving health equity (the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/crchd/about-health-disparities/definitions">attainment of the highest level of health for all people</a>&rdquo;), eliminating disparities, and improving the health of all groups are overarching goals of Healthy People 2020. These also have been 
					 a major thrust of all of the programs within DCCPS since the division&rsquo;s inception. The broad area of health equity and disparities has benefitted significantly from transdisciplinary research teams in identifying the factors that contribute to and exacerbate inequities. Social determinants of health, conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks, are mostly responsible for health inequities, the unfair and avoidable factors in health status seen within and between countries.</p>
					<p>The division has a very broad-based perspective on funding and conducting research on adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups&mdash;groups delineated by gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, income, social class, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation&mdash;to inform prevention and intervention programs. Current funding opportunities such as the TCRB funding opportunity mentioned on page 16, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-464.html">Research to Improve Native American Health</a>, and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-484.html">Collaborative Minority Health and Health Disparities Research with Tribal Epidemiology Centers</a> support cancer research to better understand and ultimately to eliminate health disparities in
					 these populations. Looking to the future, we hope to increase our investment in developing interventions for underserved and disadvantaged populations through a complement of scientific activities that will reduce the burden of these factors, inform policy, and improve overall health.</p>
