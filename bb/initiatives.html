        	<h1>DCCPS Signature Initiatives</h1>
            <p>DCCPS funds a number of large, signature initiatives across the cancer control research continuum, including</p>          
<ul>
    <li>Integrated surveillance systems;</li>
    <li>Epidemiology consortia, registries, and large-scale genetic studies;</li>
    <li>Transdisciplinary science centers to address public health challenges;</li>
    <li>Networks and consortia to examine quality of care and outcomes; and </li>
    <li>Tobacco control research initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>These initiatives are often carried out in collaboration with our partners at other agencies and research organizations, both within the United States and globally. Below, we highlight selected examples of currently funded initiatives to illustrate the capacity, variety, and breadth of these large initiatives.</p>

    <h2>Cohorts and Consortia </h2>
    <div><img src="images/NCI-Cohort.png" alt="NCI Cohort Consortium"></div>
    <p>The <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/cohort.html">NCI Cohort Consortium</a> is an extramural-intramural partnership formed by DCCPS to address the need for large-scale collaborations to pool the large quantity of data and biospecimens necessary to conduct a wide range of cancer studies. The Consortium, through its collaborative network of investigators, provides a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach to tackling important scientific questions, economies of scale, and opportunities to quicken the pace of research. The <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/members/">NCI Cohort Consortium includes investigators responsible for more than 40 high-quality cohorts</a> involving more than 4 million people. The cohorts are international in scope and cover large and diverse populations. Extensive risk factor data are available on each cohort, and biospecimens including germline DNA collected at baseline, are available on more than 2 million individuals. Investigators team up to use common protocols and methods and to conduct coordinated parallel and pooled analyses.</p>

	<h2>Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network</h2>
	<div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/CIS-NET.png" alt="Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network"></div>
	<p>The <a href="http://cisnet.cancer.gov">Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)</a> is a consortium of NCI-sponsored investigators who use statistical modeling to improve our understanding of cancer control interventions in prevention, screening, and treatment and their effects on population trends in incidence and mortality. These models can be used to guide public health research and priorities. For example, CISNET researchers are able to analyze the real-life benefits and risks of cancer screening, as well as examine the impact of health policies such as those in tobacco control, which CISNET modelers estimated to be associated with the avoidance of 8 million premature deaths since 1964.</p>



    <h2>Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science</h2> 
    
	<div class="quote-box"><div class="dingbat"><img src="images/quote-dingbat.png" alt="small multi-colored image"></div><div class="quote">This interagency partnership brings together investigators from across the country to aid in the development and evaluation of tobacco product regulations.</div></div>
    
	<p>Despite decades of work to reduce tobacco use in the United States, it continues to be the leading cause of preventable death and disease. A new, first-of-its-kind regulatory science tobacco program, <a href="https://prevention.nih.gov/tobacco-regulatory-science-program/research-portfolio/centers">Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science (TCORS)</a>, has been designed to generate research to inform the regulation of tobacco products to protect public health. Using designated funds from the US Food and Drug Administration, TCORS is coordinated by NIH’s Office of Disease Prevention, and administered by NCI (through the DCCPS Tobacco Control Research Branch), the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This interagency partnership brings together investigators from across the country to aid in the development and evaluation of tobacco product regulations. Taken together, the 14 TCORS sites will increase knowledge across the full spectrum of basic and applied research on tobacco and addiction. The program also provides young investigators with training opportunities to ensure the development of the next generation of tobacco regulatory scientists.</p>


    <h2>Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens</h2>
    <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/PROSPR.png" alt="Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens"></div>
    <p>Evidence-based cancer screening can save lives, but only if people get screened. The <a href="http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/prospr/">Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) Initiative</a>, a major research effort funded by DCCPS, supports research to better understand how to improve the screening process (recruitment, screening, diagnosis, referral for treatment) for breast, colon, and cervical cancers. As of 2014, the initiative had assembled data for 3,311,749 patients, 14,489 providers, and 3,918 facilities from a diverse set of institutions that reflect the complexity of medical care in our country. The overall aim of PROSPR is to develop multisite, coordinated, transdisciplinary research to document the entire screening process to evaluate and improve it. To accomplish this aim, the centers study the comparative effectiveness of existing and emerging screening processes in community practice; examine the balance of benefits and harms across recognized cancer risk profiles; and conduct preliminary studies to inform future research to optimize screening. The PROSPR Initiative is uniquely positioned to contribute to efforts to identify individuals most likely to benefit from cancer screening and to create efficient processes to ensure that screened individuals receive high-quality and timely care.</p>
    
    <h2>NCI Community Oncology Research Program </h2>
    <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/NCORP.png" alt="NCI Community Oncology Research Program "></div>
    <p>The <a href="http://ncorp.cancer.gov">NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)</a> is a national network of investigators, cancer care providers, academic institutions, and other organizations serving as stakeholders in the conduct of cancer research. NCORP conducts multisite cancer clinical trials and studies in diverse populations in community health care settings across the United States. The overall goal of the program is to bring cancer clinical trials, as well as cancer care delivery research, to individuals in their own communities, generating evidence that contributes to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in cancer disparities. Enabling cancer patients to join research studies in their own communities allows them to stay close to family, friends, support systems, and their local physicians and health organizations, where high-quality clinical studies result in better care. In collaboration with the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities, and the Division of Cancer Prevention (which leads NCORP), DCCPS provides leadership for the program’s Cancer Care Delivery Research activities.</p> 


    <h2>Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network</h2>
    <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/CPCRN.png" alt="Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network"></div>
    <p>A collaboration of DCCPS and the CDC’s National Center of Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the <a href="http://cpcrn.org">Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network (CPCRN)</a> is a national network of academic, public health, and community partners who work together to reduce the burden of cancer, especially among those disproportionately affected. Its members conduct community-based participatory cancer research across its 10 network centers, crossing academic affiliations and geographic boundaries, to accelerate the adoption of evidence-based cancer prevention and control in communities, through increased understanding of the dissemination and implementation process. The CPCRN is a thematic research network of the Prevention Research Centers, which are CDC’s flagship programs for preventing and controlling chronic diseases. Having a network with broad geographic reach and strong relationships among investigators allows the network to achieve more than any individual center could achieve on its own. </p>

    <h2>Collaborative Research on Addiction</h2>
    <div class="sidebar-image-left"><img src="images/NIH-CRA.png" alt="Collaborative Research on Addiction at NIH"></div>
    <p>Social networking sites and social media interactions present an important data source for understanding health behaviors and attitudes, including the use and abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. However, current scientific evidence for social media’s utility in health promotion is limited and inconclusive. To address this emerging area, DCCPS and its partners (the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute on Drug Abuse) in the trans-NIH initiative known as <a href="http://addictionresearch.nih.gov">Collaborative Research on Addiction (CRAN)</a>  recently released a Funding Opportunity Announcement (“Using Social Media to Understand and Address Substance Use and Addiction”) to inspire and support research projects investigating the role of social media in risk behaviors associated with the use and abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, and projects using social media to ameliorate such behaviors. The strong collaborative framework that CRAN provides enables this type of critical new research by integrating resources and expertise to advance substance use, abuse, and addiction research and public health outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Person-Centered Assessment Resource</h2>
    <p>The Person-Centered Assessment Resource (PCAR), funded in 2014, is a new trans-NIH initiative to support the development of a person-centered outcomes measurement information system, called <i>Health Measures</i>, which will be released in spring 2015. The initiative is led by NCI through DCCPS, with support from 12 NIH institutes, offices, and centers. The purpose of the PCAR is to support the creation of a single research resource to support, administer, and provide an integrated platform for automated use of four measurement information systems, originally developed as separate NIH programs: the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, Quality of Life Outcomes in Neurological Disorders, the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function, and the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System. These four systems measure a complement of important health outcomes from an individual’s perspective or provide performance measures of function. In combination, these systems cover the spectrum of health and disease and can be used among healthy individuals, in the general population, in clinical research and trials, and in clinical settings.</p>
