        	<h1>Vision for Cancer Control</h1>
            <h2>The Behavioral Research Program</h2>
            <p>Cancer morbidity and mortality are greatly affected by behaviors such as tobacco use, physical activity, vaccination, and sun exposure, and by psychological and behavioral processes including stress, cognition, emotion, and communication. With this in mind, the Behavioral Research Program (BRP) initiates and supports a comprehensive program of research ranging from basic behavioral research to the development, testing, and dissemination of behavioral interventions. BRP advances the extramural research agenda in cancer prevention and control not only by developing new funding initiatives, but also by building and strengthening collaborative networks and providing research tools that encourage innovative scientific exploration and study design.</p>
 
 <div class="sidebar-image-right"><img src="images/vision-1.jpg" alt="Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch meeting"></div>
 
<p>Changes in the health and scientific landscape are posing many important new demands on behavioral research in these areas. For example, it will be important to investigate the health effects of new tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, and the impact of such products on cessation and uptake. Food marketing and labeling continues to shift public perception as the prevalence of obesity is on the rise. Genetic risk information is increasingly accessible and may influence medical decision making. The way in which people get their health information in general continues to evolve. </p>

<p>Fortunately, new data sources and methodologies have created novel ways of addressing the changing paradigm in health behavior research. Technological innovations can be leveraged to deliver high-impact interventions at low cost, and mobile phones and sensor technology can collect, analyze, and integrate behavioral information. Social media activity can provide a window into how people construe and act on health recommendations, and linkages between macro- and micro-level data sources offer the opportunity to adopt a multilevel approach to understanding behavior and the downstream effects of behavior on cancer incidence, progression, and quality of life.</p> 

<div class="quote-box"><div class="dingbat"><img src="images/quote-dingbat.png" alt="small multi-colored image"></div><div class="quote">Social media activity can provide a window into how people construe and act on health recommendations&#8230;</div></div>

<p>It is also important to consider how a wide variety of disciplines can inform and complement existing behavioral research to advance public health. For example, the science of attention and vision can clarify how laypeople process warning labels and how radiologists view mammography scans; the science of communication can contribute to our understanding of how people cope with uncertainty and ever-changing health recommendations; the science of taste perception can facilitate our understanding of how flavors may influence the use of tobacco; and the science of relationships and social support can elucidate effects of the cancer experience by both patients and caregivers. In addition, computer scientists, engineers, and system scientists can apply novel models to the interpretation of longitudinal behavioral data; and anthropologists and sociologists can ensure that cultural practices and norms are taken into account when attempting to intervene on cancer-relevant behaviors.</p> 

<p>In the BRP, we continue to engage our research community as we move forward with emergent areas of scientific emphasis. Researchers, prospective grantees, and trainees are welcome to contact us to learn more about behavioral research at NCI: <a href="http://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/">staffprofiles.cancer.gov</a>.</p> 

<h2>The Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program</h2>
<p>The division’s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP) is the world’s largest funder of cancer epidemiology research. EGRP provides funding opportunities for scientists to increase understanding of cancer occurrence and outcomes in human populations. The program promotes interdisciplinary collaborations and the development and use of resources and technologies to advance cancer epidemiology and its translation into clinical and public health practice. </p>

<p>Over the years, EGRP has funded large-scale epidemiologic studies that have been instrumental in assessing risk factors for almost all types of cancer, cancer precursors, and response to interventions, as well as survivorship and outcomes. EGRP also promotes inter- and multidisciplinary <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/">consortia</a> that can answer unique questions in cancer occurrence and outcomes by pooling data from many institutions across the world and facilitating the translation of these findings to clinical and public health applications. Additionally, epidemiology <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/cohorts.html">cohorts</a> funded by NCI and other funding agencies have joined together to examine risk factors for occurrence and outcomes of cancer and other common diseases, as well as the relationship between cancer and other health outcomes in diverse populations. </p>

<div class="quote-box"><div class="dingbat"><img src="images/quote-dingbat.png" alt="small multi-colored image"></div><div class="quote">&#8230;EGRP has funded large-scale epidemiologic studies that have been instrumental in assessing risk factors for almost all types of cancer&#8230;</div></div>

<p>Epidemiologic research increasingly integrates tools of molecular biology, genomics, and other “omic” fields — along with refined social, behavioral, and environmental measurements at the individual, community, and health system levels — in addition to assessing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. These advances require significant core infrastructure and bioinformatics support.</p>
 
<p>In 2012, EGRP initiated an <a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/site/misc/21st_century.xhtml">ongoing strategic planning effort</a> to develop scientific priorities for cancer epidemiology research in the next decade, during a period of great scientific advances and resource constraints. EGRP is engaging the research community and other stakeholders to help shape new foci for research, especially in the applications of new methods and technologies that can be integrated into cancer epidemiology. These foci include developing, maintaining, and optimizing cohorts needed to study cancer and related outcomes; using epidemiology to inform and complement treatment and prevention trials; and developing epidemiologic approaches to integrating knowledge emerging from basic, clinical, and population sciences.</p> 

 <div class="sidebar-image-right"><img src="images/vision-2.jpg" alt="Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program meetng"></div>

<p>EGRP, along with grantees, collaborators, and stakeholders, developed eight broad recommendations for funding agencies, professional societies, and the research community to shape the future of cancer epidemiology following the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/events/century-trends/">Trends in 21st Century Epidemiology Workshop</a> held in 2012. Those goals, in brief, are to</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Extend the reach of epidemiology beyond initial discoveries and a focus on etiology;</li> 
    <li>Change the practice of epidemiology by providing greater access to data, metadata, and specimens to foster collaboration;</li> 
    <li>Expand cohort studies across the life span and include multiple health outcomes; </li>
    <li>Develop and evaluate novel technologies for use 
    in population studies;</li> 
    <li>Develop systematic approaches to managing, analyzing, displaying, and interpreting large, complex datasets;</li> 
    <li>Expand knowledge integration;</li> 
    <li>Transform epidemiology training; and </li>
    <li>Develop and design rational, cost-effective resources to optimize funding for epidemiology studies, accelerate translation, and maximize health impacts.</li> 
</ul>

<p>EGRP plans to continue its progress toward implementing and expanding upon these recommendations in 2015 and looks forward to collaborating with the research community to accomplish these goals. </p>

<h2>Health Disparities and Equity Research</h2>
<p>The broad area of heath equity and disparities has benefited significantly from transdisciplinary research teams in delineating the factors that contribute and exacerbate these inequities. These factors, referred to as the social determinants of health (SDOH), are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels, which are themselves influenced by policy choices. Because these factors are avoidable, they can be addressed through a complement of scientific activities that will reduce the burden of these factors and improve overall health.</p>
 
  <div class="sidebar-image-right"><img src="images/vision-3.jpg" alt="Sign outside of the National Cancer Institute"></div>
 
<p>Social determinants of health (SDOH) can be understood as conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, including the health system. Research in the area of SDOH largely focuses on delineating differences among racial/ethnic groups and understanding the barriers in care for specific underserved populations and the subsequent development of behavioral interventions for these groups. These interventions for the large part, have been partially successful but have not consistently sought to change the conditions in which people live, work, and play. Despite the growing evidence of the effects of SDOH on both short- and long-term health outcomes, there is little emphasis on developing theory and evidence-based multilevel and population (community) interventions that target both structural and individual factors. For these interventions to be effective, it necessitates the development of new measures on inequity, social environment, the adaptation of existing measures of SDOH, and a comprehensive understanding of the pathways by which the social context affects health.</p>

<p>In developing multilevel interventions, we must consider important questions. What are the key factors influencing cancer prevention strategies? How can we design and implement culturally appropriate interventions among indigent and medically underserved populations (including cancer survivors) to improve the health and quality of life of these populations? To what extent are clinical and community-based intervention programs designed to address cancer disparities informed by evidence from science, practice, and policy, and are they sustainable in real-life context? </p>

<p>Some general areas of focus would be the development of models and tools for measuring the effects of social context (i.e., place, built environment) on health among diverse populations; models to compare the effects of social context on health patterns and trends within various settings — including community and clinical settings; and common measures for greater interoperability. Another key area of focus would be real-time data and changing technology. For example, how can these be garnered to have greater impact on health promotion and disease prevention in low-income and ‘hard-to-reach’ populations? </p>

<p>While focusing on improving the health of the population, it is imperative that we also ensure that every sector of society benefits equally from the developments in health. In this regard, we encourage conducting research in small populations that are largely excluded from clinical trials and interventions due to their limited size (such as refugees, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender, and African American subpopulations). Focusing on research in these small populations and subpopulations requires improved methodologies and selection of an appropriate sample size that will allow for generalizations to the subpopulations across the United States. Some areas of further exploration are required on adapting or developing designs and statistical tools to conduct research on small populations, as well as on determining how evidence-based interventions from other large populations can be adapted to smaller diverse populations. What are the design and statistical factors that need to be considered when testing and implementing multilevel interventions? How can the concept of place be incorporated in these studies? Can these differences in communities be explained by social, environmental, or ecological factors?</p>

<p>As we plan for the coming decade, these are just a few of the questions that will need to be considered and integrated into research conducted across the cancer control continuum.</p>

<h2>Implementation Science</h2>
<p>The Implementation Science Team of DCCPS seeks to achieve the rapid integration of scientific evidence, practice, and policy, into real-world public health and clinical service systems. The ultimate goal is to improve the effect of research on cancer outcomes and promote health across individual, organizational, and community levels. NCI-funded implementation science research is conducted through research institutions in the United States and internationally with funding through trans-NIH opportunities with other divisions and centers and also with other programs in DCCPS.</p> 

 <div class="sidebar-image-right"><img src="images/vision-4.jpg" alt="Implementation Science meeting"></div>

<p>The DCCPS Implementation Team has spent several years building and sustaining the field of dissemination and implementation science to enhance the integration of evidence-based guidelines, programs, and policies across the cancer control continuum, from primary prevention to end-of-life care. Over the years, the division has developed a multitude of initiatives, tools, trainings, and funding opportunities to improve the connection of research to practice, policy, and the community. The team engages with researchers, practitioners, and public health decision makers to determine the best connection between cancer interventions and practice. Notable examples include the Research to Reality (R2R) online community of practice; the Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. (Plan, Link, Act, Network with Evidence-based Tools) web portal that links public health professionals to evidence-based cancer control resources; the newly redesigned State Cancer Profiles website, providing dynamic views of cancer statistics; the <i>Cancer Trends Progress Report</i>, with timely cancer-related data and trends throughout the cancer control continuum; and the searchable database Research-tested Intervention Programs, also known as RTIPs, where program planners and public health practitioners can access over 150 interventions. To support new investigators, the team supports a series of training and education opportunities and resources, including webinars, conferences, and the annual Training Institute for Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health. In the funding arena, the Trans-NIH Funding Announcements for Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health encourage investigators to submit innovative research grant applications.</p>

<p>Collectively with our funded research community and partners, we have made tremendous progress in developing research capacity in the field, robust and rigorous conceptual models, empirically supported implementation strategies to embed effective practices in a range of health care settings, and a promising new cohort of talented investigators to catapult the field forward. We are now at a critical point to reap the benefits of the years of field development and to make a profound impact on the cancer community, and by extension, the broader biomedical enterprise as we plan for the next generation of initiatives in research, practice, training, and policy.</p>

<p>We are seeing exciting new research directions pursued — studies of local adaptation and sustainability of evidence-based practices, implementation science in the global context, investigations of rational de-implementation of suboptimal practices, and evolution of interventions to promote ongoing improvement — work that builds upon what we have collectively developed in the implementation science field, and the promise of greater impact of the research community on significantly narrowing the gap between what is possible in cancer care and what is standard practice. While so much progress has been made in better understanding etiology, epidemiology, and personalized treatments for cancer, we still recognize that the overwhelming majority of care takes place outside of the academic medical center, and much more can be done to improve surveillance, screening, reach of treatment, and ongoing monitoring. In this era of new data tools and resources, we see a broad range of activities that can expand current platforms for conducting implementation science, leverage technologies to improve the matching and delivery of effective interventions as needed by populations across the cancer continuum, and support the sustainability and ongoing evolution of cancer clinical and community practice. </p>

<h2>The Healthcare Delivery Research Program</h2>
<p>NCI leads the nation in championing research on the health and functioning of individuals with cancer, from screening and diagnosis, through treatment and beyond. Cancer care spans many years, making the quality of that care, as well as the quality of life of individuals living with a history of cancer and those caring for them, major national concerns. The goal of initiatives related to health services research at NCI is to improve survival and enhance the patient experience across the cancer control continuum (from risk assessment and preventive care, to screening, diagnosis, and treatment, through follow-up care and end-of-life care), and to reduce the financial burden related to care (both direct and indirect costs such as lost productivity, job loss, and time costs associated with treatment).</p>

 <div class="sidebar-image-right"><img src="images/vision-6.jpg" alt="Two members of the Healthcare Delivery Research Program typing on a computer" ></div>

<p>Ongoing health care reforms, the growing number of cancer survivors, and the costs and varied quality of cancer care are just a few examples of changes in science, policy, and cancer trends that need to be considered and addressed in the coming decade. As we plan for the future, we are building on successful activities we have in place, while also addressing the new challenges and opportunities for cancer control research in the context of health care systems. </p>

<p>Significant changes have been underway with the creation of the new Healthcare Delivery Research Program (HDRP) and efforts to expand health services research. DCCPS formed this new program from three existing branches (the Health Services and Economics Research Branch, the Outcomes Research Branch, and the Process of Care Research Branch), to serve as the foundation around which health services work throughout DCCPS will be organized. Over the next year, the HDRP will be engaging internal and external experts to identify the most important scientific questions and objectives for the next decade. The group will be asked to focus on NCI’s unique role within the broader landscape of research funders, given that this context has changed substantially over the past few years. What do we need to know 10 years from now to inform our nation’s cancer control strategy within the context of health care systems?</p> 

<p>We have exceptional and broad expertise to draw upon within the division. We also have a long history of working alongside many of our grantees and other stakeholders, who participate in workshops, focus groups, and online forums to contribute ideas and feedback for scientific areas across the division. Based in large part upon the expert input we receive, we will be creating new funding announcements and additional initiatives to energize and support the cancer control community and grow the health services research portfolio. As we develop initiatives, we will strive to communicate our priorities and goals broadly, as well as continually assess and evaluate our progress. All changes are — and will continue to be — informed and guided by our scientific objectives.</p>

<h2>The Office of Cancer Survivorship</h2>
<p>Created in 1996, the goal of the Office of Cancer Survivorship is to improve the length and quality of life of those diagnosed with and treated for cancer. The office pursues this mission through the promotion of research that identifies and seeks to address the many challenges faced by individuals living long-term after cancer, the training of scientists and practitioners in survivorship issues, and the communication of research findings to the scientific community, as well as to the public and survivors themselves. In the past two decades, understanding of the long-term and late-occurring effects of surviving a cancer diagnosis has expanded rapidly. Cancer survivorship is now broadly recognized as a unique place on the cancer control continuum. Furthermore, the number of researchers and clinicians working in the cancer survivorship space is increasing.</p>
 
  <div class="sidebar-image-right"><img src="images/vision-9.jpg" alt="Office of Cancer Survivorship staff categories"></div>
 
<p>As the population of long-term survivors continues to expand, new questions and challenges are emerging, along with opportunities to address them. Is the pattern of treatment toxicities changing as treatments evolve, and, if so, how? Are there lifestyle behaviors or surveillance practices in which survivors should engage that will lead to reduced morbidity or mortality after cancer? These are just a few of many questions that survivor cohorts may enable us to examine — and more survivor cohorts are expected in response to revisions to the cohort infrastructure program announcement (PAR). Another open PAR seeks a better understanding of the specific mechanisms by which energy balance interventions may affect recurrence and survival. In addition, two active Survivorship Care Planning program announcements invite researchers to explore how individuals who have survived their illness should be followed and cared for — and by whom — after treatment ends. Can we design and systematically deliver multilevel interventions with the potential to reduce the adverse consequences of living beyond cancer? As survivorship science has matured, we are seeing a corresponding — and necessary — shift in funded projects away from descriptive studies to those that seek to prevent or ameliorate the problems identified. What is the role of family caregivers in improving survivors’ physical and psychosocial outcomes? This is a topic we will be exploring at scientific meetings in 2015.</p>

<p>Other, broader trends also serve to influence the focus of research. With the aging of the baby boomer population, it is clear that we need more information on the health and functioning of older cancer survivors, in particular. In addition, the shift to use of more oral medications is bringing attention to efforts to maximize adherence to long-term treatment regimens. As survivorship science evolves, there is pressure to identify metrics that will permit us to better understand the impact this research is having on survivors’ lives. For example, <i>Healthy People 2020</i> has called for us to show that we are improving the psychosocial well-being of cancer survivors, and yet we have no ready database to track these outcomes.</p> 

<p>The new vision in survivorship is one in which we strive to extend the health span of all cancer survivors and their loved ones. It is a future in which survivors are full partners in this effort at all levels of activity. With survivorship science now fully integrated across DCCPS, we can better leverage the more than 50 resident experts to direct and champion the broad range of topics involved in promoting sophisticated survivorship science into the future. </p>

<h2>The Surveillance Research Program</h2>
<p>The Surveillance Research Program (SRP) provides national leadership in the science of cancer surveillance through its analytical tools and methodological expertise in collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating reliable population-based cancer statistics. This surveillance infrastructure benefits the public, policymakers, and scientists by improving understanding of changes in cancer incidence and outcomes in all segments of the US population over time. SRP manages the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, which is an integrated, comprehensive, multiple population-based reporting system. The SEER Program has been supporting research on the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of cancer since 1973. The group of SEER Registries has expanded over time to best represent epidemiologically significant population subgroups, and it now covers 28% of the US population. Data from the SEER Registries are a core component of the SEER Cancer Statistics Review (CSR), which is an annual report of the most recent cancer incidence, mortality, survival, prevalence, and lifetime risk statistics. </p>

 <div class="sidebar-image-right"><img src="images/vision-7.jpg" alt="Surveillance Research Program staff photo"></div>

<p>SRP seeks to promote and enhance the science of cancer surveillance as the gold standard for generating timely, complete, and accurate cancer surveillance data. SRP leadership, in developing statistical methodologies and tools, as well as in providing a surveillance infrastructure, will support cancer research in changing health care, technology, and scientific environments. </p>

<p>Health care systems have become more complex with the increasing sophistication of diagnosis, treatment, coordination of care, and follow-up plans. The evolution of technology in medicine has required improved data collection methods. We are currently piloting systems for capturing data from electronic medical records using natural language processing. The SEER Program’s new data capture initiatives include increasing the efficiency of data collection through linkages with existing electronic data sources, including claims and direct laboratory feeds. Automating data collection from these other sources will provide more timely, accurate, and complete data, which will support cancer research in a more relevant manner. </p>

<p>Developments in science, such as genome sequencing, have unlocked new sources of information in oncology. To fully realize its purpose, the cancer surveillance field must constantly improve data collection methods to incorporate and analyze the new information. A central focus of SRP’s vision is for the SEER Registries to progress toward supporting a broader scope of cancer research, generating data that are uniquely available via these population-based systems. These research initiatives will include understanding precision medicine in populations (through capture of predictive and prognostic biomarkers) and supporting exploratory basic and clinical research through tools such as the Virtual SEER-Linked Biorepository. SEER will also support the addition of critical data points along the cancer continuum, including the capture of outcomes other than survival (e.g., disease progression or recurrence). We will also collect more detailed information on treatment, especially oral antineoplastics.</p> 

<p>As we plan for the next decade, we have several important goals: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Maintain our level of high-quality data standards despite increases in the amount and complexity of information; </li>
    <li>Consolidate information from multiple sources that, over long periods of time, may provide conflicting data; and </li>
    <li>Ensure data completeness.</li>
</ol> 
<p>The initiatives briefly described earlier summarize the approach that SRP is taking to position SEER Registries to meet 21st century research needs. We have already begun expanding our activities to address the constantly evolving fields of technology and medicine. With each new scientific advancement, SRP will continue to assess and plan the application or development of necessary methods in cancer surveillance. </p>
