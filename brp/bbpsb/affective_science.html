      <br />
      This Funding Opportunity (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-14-067.html">PAR-14-067</a>) will support research to generate new  fundamental knowledge of affective processes. Successful basic affective  science projects must have downstream consequences for single and multiple  event decisions and behaviors in cancer prevention and control. However,  projects do not necessarily need to examine these decisions and behaviors  directly, as long as future cancer implications are clearly defined.<br />
      Scientists within disciplines not traditionally  focused on cancer research are encouraged to apply. Such disciplines might  include (but are not limited to): affective and cognitive science, decision  science, consumer science, and neuroscience. <br />
      Letters of Intent to apply will be accepted beginning in  May 2014.

      <h3 id="overview">Overview and  Objectives</h3>
      <p>        Recent  strategic planning efforts have highlighted the importance of research that  elucidates the role of affect, and specifically emotion, in cancer control.  Such research may have important theoretical and clinical implications for the  reduction of cancer risk and the improvement in cancer outcomes.</p>
      <p>        Scientific  evidence from a variety of domains suggest that affect may be a critical determinant  of information processing, sensory perceptions, judgment and decision-making,  cancer prevention and health promotion behaviors, and cancer outcomes. However,  additional research is needed on the nature of affective phenomena, including  the associations among affect and other processes/outcomes, as well as to  identify underlying biological and psychological mechanisms. It is critical for  us to gain a better understanding of the nature and utility of psychological  experiences like stress, emotion, emotion regulation, and resilience.</p>

<h3 id="specific">Specific Aims </h3>
      <p>        The  Basic Biobehavioral and Psychological Sciences Branch (BBPSB) seeks to fund  innovative affective science research that has potential downstream benefits  for cancer prevention and control. Basic biobehavioral and psychological  science related to cancer-related outcomes may include the following areas of  examination:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Affective states as they relate       to judgments and decisions relevant to cancer (e.g., cancer risk behaviors       such as poor energy balance and tobacco use; informed consent; clinical       cancer care; response to placebo conditions in cancer clinical trials; cancer       communication)</li>
        <li>Affective responses to social       experiences and potential influences on biological processes associated       with cancer progression and outcome</li>
        <li>Affect in cancer survivorship       experiences and trajectories</li>
        <li>Affective phenomena (e.g.,       emotion, stress, mood) and mechanisms by which these may influence cancer       outcomes</li>
        <li>Associations among affect and       cognition, social cognition, expectancy, hedonics, sensation, and       perception</li>

      <p><strong><a href="docs/Affective-Science-Cancer-Control-Workshop-Agenda-2011.pdf">AGENDA</a></strong></p>
      <p>        In  the first workshop in this series, we explored how affective science might  inform important questions and gaps in knowledge along the cancer continuum.  The meeting brought leading experts in affective science together with NCI  cancer prevention and control scientists. NCI scientists presented synthesized  reviews of important questions in respective domains across the cancer control  continuum. These presentations were followed by commentary from an affective  scientist discussant, and general discussion among all scientists present.<br />
        Interesting  questions emerged from the workshop deliberations, including, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In which situations, or for       which outcomes, are affective reactions (such as stress or specific       emotions) normative vs. maladaptive?</li>
        <li>Do affective states influence       the biology of cancer, and vice versa?</li>
        <li>Does recovery from stress or       negative affective states mitigate the effects of these affects on       biological outcomes? Can positive affect counteract biological effects of       stress or other negative affective states?</li>
        <li>What role do affective       processes play in perception and memory as they relate to expectation?</li>
        <li>Is affect a source of bias in       healthcare and clinical trial contexts?</li>
        <li>Do specific affective states or       environments facilitate optimal processing of information, and can these       be targeted in intervention or implemented in clinical settings?</li>
        <li>Is it possible to objectively       disentangle affective responses from physiological sensations, pleasure,       or craving? Which are the best predictors of cancer-related behaviors, and       which are easiest to target or influence?</li>
        <li>What are the temporal dynamics       of emotional responding?</li>
        <li>How can we best measure affect       in various contexts (e.g., survivorship, aging, etc.)?</li>
        <li>How do shared affective states       or &ldquo;emotional contagion&rdquo; influence cancer-related behaviors and cancer       trajectories our outcomes?</li>
        <li>What role do affective       complexity, mixed affective states, chronicity, and habituation play in       health communication?</li>
        <li>How can we leverage existing       theoretical models, methodological rigor, and empirical innovation in       affective science to influence tangible cancer outcomes? </li>

      <h2 id="workshop2">Emotion and Stress  (April 2012)</h2>
      <p><strong><a href="docs/NCI-Workshop-on-Emotion-and-Stress.pdf">AGENDA</a></strong></p>
      <p>        The  second workshop examined the associations between emotion and stress, two  affective phenomena that might have particular relevance to cancer prevention  through their influence on cancer-related behaviors and biological outcomes.  Research in emotion and stress uses similar methodology and faces similar  theoretical challenges, but the lines of research in each area are often  disconnected, and most researchers examine (or believe they examine) one but  not the other. The goal for this workshop was to explore the utility of  theoretical and methodological integration of emotion and stress, start to  develop an integrated approach that would help to solve some of the pressing  issues in both fields, and stimulate their study in a cancer context.</p>
<p>During the course of this workshop, it became apparent that similarities  between emotion and stress may outweigh differences, and that differences may  be due in part to research focus rather than real differences between the two  constructs. For example, stress research tends to focus on the architecture of  the situation, whereas emotion research often places more emphasis on the  subjective experience. Certainly, empirical research is necessary to determine  whether emotion and stress can be integrated. Regardless, each field offers  theoretical and methodological tools that may be adopted to further the other. </p>
<p align="right">[<a href="#">Return to Top</a>]</p>
      <h2 id="workshop3">Emotion  Regulation and Resilience (July 2012)</h2>
      <p><strong><a href="docs/New-Horizons-in-Emotional-Regulation-and-Resilience.pdf">AGENDA</a></strong> </p>
      <p>Our third workshop, <em>New  Horizons in Emotion Regulation and Resilience</em>, sought to generate new  research questions and scientific perspectives in emotion regulation and  resilience through scholarly discourse, debate, and reflections. We hoped to  encourage basic psychological scientists to consider cancer as an ecologically  valid research context and to translate existing knowledge in emotion  regulation and resilience to cancer control. </p>
      <p>        All of the participants actively and enthusiastically  challenged each others&rsquo; thinking. While some old debates on the nature of  psychological phenomena were revisited – such as whether the distinction  between affect, cognition, and perception is biological or culturally-based –  progress was made in thinking about when such distinctions are useful, and when  they obscure scientific progress. Importantly, workshop participants, even  those who do not examine emotion regulation and resilience in a cancer context,  were able to generate ideas about how cancer could be leveraged to examine  basic affective processes, and how knowledge in emotion regulation and  resilience can be leveraged to improve cancer outcomes. Our discourse  highlighted themes that have emerged across our series of workshops like the  importance of expanding our time scale in experimental and natural studies;  modeling heterogeneity and complexity in individuals and contexts;  emotion/affect as distributed phenomena; and, the need for advances in the  science of subjective experiences. </p>
      <p>Connections  between emotion regulation, resilience, and cancer control were highlighted in  the workshop. More basic research on emotion regulation and resilience could  certainly lead to more effective efforts to improve cancer patients&rsquo;  psychological health and well-being. Moreover, a better understanding of  emotion regulation could shed light on potentially effective ways to change  maladaptive cancer-risk behaviors used to regulate negative affective states  (such as smoking, non-homeostatic eating, and alcohol consumption).
