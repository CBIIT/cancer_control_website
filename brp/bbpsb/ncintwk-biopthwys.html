    <p>Dr. Costanzo is a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. She is a clinical health psychologist specializing in the care and treatment of individuals coping with cancer and their family members. Dr. Costanzo's research focuses on contributions of psychosocial factors to the health and well-being of cancer patients, and the biobehavioral pathways underlying these relationships, with the translational goal of developing targeted behavioral interventions for individuals with cancer. This work draws on her background in behavioral medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, and cancer control, and benefits from close, multidisciplinary collaborations.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong> Dr. Costanzo's project examines gene expression patterns of CD14+ cells as a potential pathway by which stress-related psychosocial factors may influence immune recovery and clinical outcomes following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The study focuses on multiple myeloma patients recovering from autologous HSCT, given evidence for the role of CD14+ derived macrophages in immune recovery as well as angiogenesis, apoptosis, and production of disease-promoting cytokines in this population. The primary aim is to examine the relationship of stress-related psychosocial factors with gene expression patterns of CD14+ cells.  The proposed research will help define new molecular mechanisms of biobehavioral influences in the development and progression of hematologic malignancies.</p>

    University of California, Los Angeles</em></p></div> 
    
    <p>Dr. Naomi Eisenberger is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at UCLA and the Jeffrey/Wenzel Term Chair in Behavioral Neuroscience. Dr. Eisenberger specializes in social neurocognitive aspects of emotion and behavior. Her primary line of research utilizes neuroimaging techniques to investigate the neural correlates of social rejection and social connection. Through this line of research, she has demonstrated that the experience of social rejection relies, in part, on physical pain-related neural regions and that the experience of social connection relies, in part, on reward-related neural regions. Her work also examines the bidirectional relationships between sensitivity to social rejection and inflammatory activity, which may have implications for depression. Findings have demonstrated that greater social pain-related neural activity in response to social rejection is associated with greater inflammatory responding and that inflammatory activity can lead to increases in felt social disconnection and greater social pain-related neural activity in response to rejection. Dr. Eisenberger, who received her PhD in 2005, has published more than 70 papers including articles in top tier journals (Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Neuroscience). Her work has also been recognized with several early career awards included ones from the American Psychosomatic Society, the Association for Psychological Science, and the International Union of Psychological Science.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong>  In Dr. Eisenberger's project, she will utilize her expertise in social and affective neuroscience to broaden the understanding of fMRI-based research on behavioral probe paradigms and empirical neural activity correlates of social support, attachment, affiliation and related psychological constructs. Her work will set the stage to identify specific psychological/neurobiological pathways that might mediate relationships between social support/attachment and Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) activity in humans.</p>

    University of California, Los Angeles</em></p></div> 
    
    <p>Dr. Lamkin is a postdoctoral fellow at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. He received his PhD in Health Psychology from the University of Iowa. Dr. Lamkin's current research in leukemia is built upon several excellent experiences in laboratories that study cancer biology, immunology, and neural regulation of these systems. Before starting his doctoral research, Dr. Lamkin worked as a research fellow at Indiana University School of Medicine, Evansville Campus, in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology on an ongoing inter-lab project that is researching the potential for a cancer vaccine for melanoma.  While completing his PhD, Dr. Lamkin examined the pathways among behavioral stress, immunological mechanisms, and cancer biology at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University of Iowa. He and his colleagues published multiple articles during that time that delineate several biological mechanisms by which behavioral and stress-related factors may influence immune system pathways and cancer progression.  At that time, Dr. Lamkin also investigated the reverse effect that cancer can have on stress-related factors as the Principal Investigator of an NCI R03 grant to develop a preclinical model of cancer-induced inflammation-mediated depression. He and his colleagues published results that showed experimentally-induced cancer can increase levels of systemic proinflammatory IL-6 and behavioral homologues of depression that can be blocked with antidepressants. While previous studies on the neural regulation of cancer biology have focused on solid tumors, Dr. Lamkin's research objective is to expand this area of work to encompass the hematopoietic cancers. To advance that agenda, he went to UCLA as a postdoctoral fellow to work with molecular biologist, Dr. Steve Cole, cancer biologist, Dr. Erica Sloan, and Dr. Kathy Sakamoto—a physician and research scientist who specializes in leukemia. Over the last two years, using a preclinical xenograft model of leukemia, they found that stressor-activated β-adrenergic circuits of the autonomic nervous system can accelerate leukemia tumor burden and dissemination. This line of research will continue to define the mechanisms involved by using animal, cellular, molecular, and immunofluorescent microscopy methods.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong> Dr. Lamkin's project will examine a potential downstream mechanism by which β-adrenergic signaling  regulates stress-induced  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  Specifically, an orthotopic mouse model of human leukemia will be used to elucidate the role of the CXCR4-CXCL12 chemokine system in stress-enhanced ALL progression.</p>

    <em>University of Colorado, Boulder</em></p></div> 
    
    <p>Dr. Wager is the director of the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience laboratory at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  He received his PhD from the University of Michigan in cognitive psychology, with a focus in cognitive neuroscience.  Dr. Wager has a deep interest in the mechanisms by which thoughts and beliefs influence brain and peripheral processes relevant for health and well being.  His laboratory takes a human systems neuroscience approach to studying the creation and regulation of pain, stress, and negative emotion. Approaches include a) experimental studies combining fMRI imaging, behavior, and peripheral physiology; b) large-scale synthesis of neuroimaging findings to develop and constrain models of brain-mind relationships; c) developing new methodological approaches to systems-level analyses of brain data; d) the use of converging methodologies such as Positron Emission Tomography, electroencephalography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation; and e) translational work extending affective neuroscience models to several mental health disorders. Dr. Wager believes that advances in human neuroscience methods, coupled with better synthesis of information on brain function across species, will bring about new ways of understanding the human condition and the factors that create and maintain healthy individuals and societies.</p>
    
	
	<p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong> This project will provide a targeted literature review of fMRI-based research on brain stem control of sympathetic nervous system activity, and its regulation by higher brain (e.g., cortical) regions. The review will specifically identify cortical and sub-cortical brain ROIs and the relevant fMRI probe paradigm tasks suitable for use in subsequent studies relating social support to SNS activation. The review will be delivered in the form of an interactive wiki page.  The primary illustration will be a 3-dimensional brain image/cartoon with hyperlinks of brain ROIs that are involved in autonomic nervous system activation in response to stressors.
