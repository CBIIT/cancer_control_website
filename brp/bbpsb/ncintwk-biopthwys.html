    <p>Dr. Costanzo is a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. She is a clinical health psychologist specializing in the care and treatment of individuals coping with cancer and their family members. Dr. Costanzo's research focuses on contributions of psychosocial factors to the health and well-being of cancer patients, and the biobehavioral pathways underlying these relationships, with the translational goal of developing targeted behavioral interventions for individuals with cancer. This work draws on her background in behavioral medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, and cancer control, and benefits from close, multidisciplinary collaborations.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong> Dr. Costanzo's project examines gene expression patterns of CD14+ cells as a potential pathway by which stress-related psychosocial factors may influence immune recovery and clinical outcomes following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The study focuses on multiple myeloma and lymphoma patients recovering from autologous HSCT, given evidence for the role of CD14+ derived macrophages in immune recovery as well as angiogenesis, apoptosis, and production of disease-promoting cytokines in this population. The primary aim is to examine the relationship of stress-related psychosocial factors with gene expression patterns of CD14+ cells. The proposed research will help define new molecular mechanisms of biobehavioral influences in the development and progression of hematologic malignancies.</p>

    University of California, Los Angeles</p></div> 
    
    <p>Dr. Naomi Eisenberger is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at UCLA and the Jeffrey/Wenzel Term Chair in Behavioral Neuroscience. Dr. Eisenberger specializes in social neurocognitive aspects of emotion and behavior. Her primary line of research utilizes neuroimaging techniques to investigate the neural correlates of social rejection and social connection. Through this line of research, she has demonstrated that the experience of social rejection relies, in part, on physical pain-related neural regions and that the experience of social connection relies, in part, on reward-related neural regions. Her work also examines the bidirectional relationships between sensitivity to social rejection and inflammatory activity, which may have implications for depression. Findings have demonstrated that greater social pain-related neural activity in response to social rejection is associated with greater inflammatory responding and that inflammatory activity can lead to increases in felt social disconnection and greater social pain-related neural activity in response to rejection. Dr. Eisenberger, who received her PhD in 2005, has published more than 70 papers including articles in top tier journals (Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Neuroscience). Her work has also been recognized with several early career awards included ones from the American Psychological Association, the American Psychosomatic Society, the Association for Psychological Science, and the International Union of Psychological Science.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong>  In Dr. Eisenberger's project, she will utilize her expertise in social and affective neuroscience to broaden the understanding of fMRI-based research on behavioral probe paradigms and empirical neural activity correlates of social support, attachment, affiliation and related psychological constructs. Her work will set the stage to identify specific psychological/neurobiological pathways that might mediate relationships between social support/attachment and Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) activity in humans.</p>

    University of California, Los Angeles</p></div> 
    
    <p>Dr. Lamkin is a postdoctoral fellow at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. He received his PhD in Health Psychology from the University of Iowa. While completing his PhD, Dr. Lamkin examined pathways among behavioral stress, immunological mechanisms, and cancer biology at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University of Iowa. At that time, Dr. Lamkin also investigated the reverse effect that cancer can have on stress-related factors by developing a preclinical model of cancer-induced inflammation-mediated depression. He and his colleagues published results that showed experimentally-induced cancer can increase levels of systemic proinflammatory IL-6 and behavioral homologues of depression that can be blocked with antidepressants. At UCLA, Dr. Lamkin has continued to develop preclinical models of cancer and biobehavioral factors. Using a preclinical xenograft model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Dr. Lamkin and his colleagues found that stressor-activated β-adrenergic circuits can accelerate leukemia tumor burden and dissemination.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong> Dr. Lamkin's project examines a potential downstream mechanism by which β-adrenergic signaling regulates stress-induced acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Specifically, an orthotopic mouse model of human leukemia is used to elucidate the role of the CXCR4-CXCL12 chemokine system in stress-enhanced leukemia progression.</p>

    <p>Dr. Wager is the director of the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience laboratory at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in cognitive psychology in 2003, and served as an Assistant and Associate Professor at Columbia University from 2004-2009. In 2010, he joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has a deep interest in how thinking influences affective experiences, affective learning, and brain-body communication. 
Dr. Wager places particular emphasis on the development and deployment of analytic methods, and has developed publically available software toolboxes for fMRI analysis, including optimized experimental design, multi-level mediation, change-point analysis, machine learning, and meta-analysis. He believes that collaborative development and open sharing of tools and data are critical ingredients in the advancement of human neuroscience.</p>
    
	
	<p><strong>Network Project Description:</strong> This project will provide a targeted literature review of fMRI-based research on brain stem control of sympathetic nervous system activity, and its regulation by higher brain (e.g., cortical) regions. The review will specifically identify cortical and sub-cortical brain ROIs and the relevant fMRI probe paradigm tasks suitable for use in subsequent studies relating social support to SNS activation. The review will be delivered in the form of an interactive wiki page. The primary illustration will be a 3-dimensional brain image/cartoon with hyperlinks of brain ROIs that are involved in autonomic nervous system activation in response to stressors.</p>
