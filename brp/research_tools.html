		<p><a href="http://hints.cancer.gov">HINTS</a><br />The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) studies how Americans find and use cancer information. The HINTS data collection program was created to monitor changes in the rapidly evolving field of health communication. Survey researchers are using the data to understand how adults 18 years and older use different communication channels, including the Internet, to obtain vital health information for themselves and their loved ones. Program planners are using the data to overcome barriers to health information usage across populations, and obtaining the data they need to create more effective communication strategies. Finally, social scientists are using the data to refine their theories of health communication in the information age and to offer new and better recommendations for reducing the burden of cancer throughout the population. Hints data are available for public use.</p>
        
		<p><a href="http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/tus-cps/">Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey</a><br />
        The Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) is a survey of tobacco use that has been administered triennially as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's and Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Population Survey since 1992. CDC co-sponsored the 2001-2007 surveys with NCI. The TUS-CPS is a key source of national, state, and some sub-state-level data on smoking and other tobacco use, and other tobacco control policy related measures in the U.S. household population. Data are used to monitor progress in the control of tobacco use, conduct research, evaluate tobacco control programs, and examine health disparities in relation to these goals. The TUS-CPS data are linkable to other CPS supplement data including some information on other cancer risk factors as well as cancer incidence/general mortality data through the National Longitudinal Mortality Study.</p>
        
		<p><a href="/brp/hbrb/flashe.html">Family   Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) Study</a><br />
The Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) study is a   National Cancer Institute (NCI) survey that examines psychosocial,   generational (parent-teen), and environmental correlates of   cancer-preventive behaviors. FLASHE will examine lifestyle   behaviors as they relate to cancer risk, mainly: diet and physical   activity; as well as: sleep, sun-safety and tobacco use.</p>

        The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States during the 1994-95 school year. The Add Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-32.  Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents' social, economic, psychological and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood. </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm">National Health Interview Survey</a><br />
        The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews. For over 50 years, the U.S. Census Bureau has been the data collection agent for the National Health Interview Survey. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives.</p>

		<p><a href="http://class.cancer.gov/">Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (C.L.A.S.S.)</a><br />
        Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (CLASS) is an empirical scoring system that monitors and evaluates state-level school physical education and nutrition policies that have been codified into law.</p>
        
		<p><a href="theories_project/index.html">Theories Project: Improving Theories of Health Behavior</a><br />
        The goal of the Theories Project is to identify and carry out activities that will help develop improved theories of health behavior. Its focus is on actions that individuals can take to prevent cancer and speed its early detection. The literature on health behavior is large, but progress in understanding health behaviors and in learning how to encourage such actions is not always apparent. Among the activities that may be considered are training in theory development and testing for health behavior researchers who lack such training, recruiting scientists with strong theory orientations to cancer behavior research, development of state-of-the-art summaries of theory-relevant topics when these are lacking, and better communication of opportunities for theory-focused research among current types of NCI grants.</p>
        
		<p><a href="constructs/index.html">Constructs and Measures for Health Behavior</a><br />
        The Health Behavior Constructs web site is based on a 2008 review and provides definitions of major theoretical constructs employed in health behavior research, and information about the best measures of these constructs. This resource is designed for health behavior researchers in public health, health communications, nursing, psychology, and related fields.</p>

        The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a publicly available Web-based resource that can be used to measure key health symptoms and health-related quality of life domains such as pain, fatigue, depression, and physical function. These domains are relevant to a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer.</p>
        
		<p><a href="https://riskfactor.cancer.gov/mfe/">Measures of the Food Environment</a><br />T
        his Web site provides a compilation of articles that include community-level measures of the food environment, as well as some of the instruments themselves. Here, we define the food environment to include food stores, restaurants, schools, and worksites. Measurement of the food environment and its effects on dietary behavior is a relatively new, but growing, field of inquiry. This Web site will be updated on a weekly basis.</p>

        This database contains questionnaire items and a list of validation studies for standardized items concerning walking and biking from multiple national and international physical activity questionnaires (PAQs). The purpose of this database is to provide easy access to a large number of items assessing duration and frequency of walking and bicycling in the non-disabled adult population. We also briefly review the results of validation studies identified for some of the PAQs.</p>
        
		<p><a href="tcrb/guide_measures.html">Measures Guide for Youth Tobacco Research</a><br />
        NCI supported researchers at Brown University, Dr. Suzanne Colby and Dr. Johanna Lewis-Esquerre, to develop a measures guide for youth tobacco research following NCI's June 2000 Youth Tobacco Research Meeting in Denver, CO. The guide is intended as a resource for anyone conducting research on youth tobacco use or intervening with adolescent tobacco users, such as clinicians and public health practitioners. The standardized and psychometrically sound measures presented in this guide were compiled via a detailed method involving its developers and researchers submitting measures for inclusion. The developers used the following inclusion criteria to evaluate each submission: English language, smoking/tobacco/nicotine, quantitative score, data from adolescents, psychometric data, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and has an identifiable name. They then examined the source articles for each measure and drafted the summary and instrument, which was then subjected to a second review. The revised, accepted measures were formalized for inclusion in the online measures guide.</p>
