He is also Director, Health Media Research Laboratory and Director, Cancer Prevention and Control at the School of Medicine at the University of Michigan.  Most recently, he became President and CEO of HealthMedia, Inc. in Ann Arbor.</p>
            <p>Dr. Strecher founded the University of Michigan’s Health Media Research Laboratory (HMRL), a multidisciplinary team of behavioral scientists, health educators, instructional designers, computer engineers, graphic artists, project managers, and students from a wide variety of disciplines (public health, epidemiology, psychology, computer engineering, information 
				science, art, music, and others).  The HMRL, along with Dr. Strecher's previous laboratory, the Health Communications Research Laboratory at the University of North Carolina, has conducted research studies and demonstration projects of computer-tailoring and interactive multimedia programs for the past eight years. </p>
            <p>Dr. Strecher’s academic interests include evaluative research of interactive health communications and health behavior change interventions. He has been principal investigator on over $10 million in research grants, many of which have been in the area of interactive health communications research. Grant-funded studies have included, among others, several computer-tailored print interventions, 
              including tailored materials to callers of the National Cancer Institute¹s Cancer Information Service (CIS); tailored materials for cigarette smoking cessation, mammography, and dietary fat reduction; tailored materials for injury victims in the emergency room; and tailored materials to HMO members based on a comprehensive health risk appraisal. Computer-based interactive multimedia interventions 
              include a program for genetic counseling on BRCA1 and BRCA2 and programs to teach women about their risks of breast cancer. Dr. Strecher received his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.</p>
