      Informatics for Consumer Health  (ICH) Archive</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Informatics for Consumer Health (ICH)</strong>&nbsp;focuses on a coordination of health information, technology, and  health care delivery that empowers providers to manage care and increases the  ability of consumers to gain mastery over their own health. This may be  accomplished by promoting the use of information technology and communication  between health care providers and their patients to share vital medical  information across clinical settings in timely and reliable ways, and utilize  electronic tools to achieve these objectives.</p>
      <p><strong>InformaticsForConsumerHealth.org</strong>&nbsp;involved stakeholders from various sectors&mdash;commercial IT,  government, health care, education and research, advocacy&mdash;exchanging ideas and  resources to bridge information technology and health care with the goal of  improving behavioral support for all consumers. Changing health behaviors is  key to improving health outcomes. Evidence-based studies have shown that  changes in basic preventive behavior&mdash;smoking cessation, better diet and  exercise, and routine screenings&mdash;have led to reductions in disability and death  due to cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.<br />
        <br />
        Effective consumer health information technology (health IT) applications hold  great promise for encouraging and supporting behavior change. Health IT allows  comprehensive management of medical information and its secure exchange between  health care consumers and providers. Innovations such as patient reminder  systems, secure messaging systems between patients and providers, in-home  monitoring tools, patient education systems, pharmaceutical error-checking  routines, and enhanced decision support tools for self-care have already  resulted in improved outcomes and reduced costs. With the passage of the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and efforts toward the adoption  of&nbsp;<a href="http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=1325&amp;parentname=CommunityPage&amp;parentid=1&amp;mode=2">meaningful  use</a>&nbsp;criteria for health  information technology, engagement centered on supporting the consumer remains  top priority.</p>
      <p>  In  2009, a collaboration of Federal Agency<u>&nbsp;</u>partners&nbsp;convened  the &ldquo;Informatics for Consumer Health: Summit on Communication, Collaboration,  and Quality&rdquo; in Potomac, MD to create a platform for innovation among  stakeholders.&nbsp; This website is structured to nurture the engagement  fostered at the&nbsp;2009 Summit, and  move forward to meet the&nbsp;mission  and goals&nbsp;of  InformaticsForConsumerHealth.org.</p>

      <h2 id="summit-overview">Summit Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>2009  ICH Summit</strong><br />
        In November 2009, a partnership of Federal  agencies convened the Informatics for Consumer Health Summit on Communication,  Collaboration, and Quality. The summit brought together nearly 200 leaders from  commercial IT, government, health care, education, research, and advocacy  organizations to open a dialogue and begin creating a blueprint for improving  health care quality through enhanced behavioral support for consumers across  the healthcare spectrum&mdash;from prevention, to diagnosis and treatment, through  hospice and palliative care. The goals of the summit were to foster  collaboration and stimulate the development and integration of evidence-based  commercial products.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Summit  Focus</h3>
      <p>Increase  the quality and utilization of evidence-based consumer products that may be  integrated into health information exchange networks.</p>
      <h3>Background/Rationale</h3>
      <p>Consumer  behavior is an essential contributor to quality improvement in health care.  Changes in basic preventive behavior&mdash;smoking cessation, better diet and  exercise, and routine screenings&mdash;have already contributed substantively to  decreases in death from cancer, from heart disease, and from diabetes.  Predictions are that better support systems will be needed in preventive care  as the U.S. population struggles with an impending epidemic of obesity and  chronic disease. Within the health care system, better support for patients has  been shown to improve quality of care in a system that is becoming increasingly  reliant on outpatient treatment. Improvements in quality and decreases in cost  have been documented through applications such as patient reminder systems,  secure messaging systems between patients and providers, in-home monitoring  tools, pharmaceutical error checking routines, patient education systems, and  enhanced decision support tools for self-care.</p>
      <p>At  the same time, the Department of Health and Human Services maintains a national  goal to improve health care through the strategic use of health information  technology. In a report released in the first quarter of 2009, the National  Research Council warned that efforts to invest in Health I.T. will be fruitless  unless they are aimed at providing better cognitive support for physicians,  patients, and their caregivers.</p>
      <p>The  purpose of this summit is to bring together the stakeholders involved in  creating a safer, higher quality health system and from a set of structured  interactions within that group to create a blueprint for improving health care  quality through enhanced behavioral support for health care consumers.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>Increase  the quality and utilization of evidence-based consumer products that may be  integrated into health information exchange networks.</p>
      <h3>Summit  Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase  collaborations and partnerships,</li>

      <h2 id="sessions">Summit Sessions</h2>
      <h3>Topic  1. Improve quality, safety, efficiency, and reduce health disparities.</h3>
      <p><strong>David Ahern, Ph.D.</strong><br />
        This goal embodies the primary objectives for quality improvement articulated  by the Institute of Medicine's Crossing the Quality Chasm report. The break out  group will focus on the contribution of consumer informatics to the question of  continuous quality improvement as described by the IOM report.</p>
      <h3>Topic  2. Improve care coordination.</h3>
      <p><strong>William Rakowski, Ph.D.</strong><br />
        One of the great promises of an interoperable electronic health record system  is the capability to bridge discontinuities of care in a fragmented health care  system. The goal becomes especially important as health care reform begins to  evolve a more pre-emptive, personalized stance. In this break-out session,  participants will identify strategies for resolving the continuity of care  problem with consumer-accessible informatics solutions. Topics to be covered  will likely include a renewed discussion of the medical home, continuity of  care records (as a technological solution), and the role of third party continuity  solutions (e.g., MS Health Vault) in bridging the gaps of an otherwise  fragmented system of care.</p>
      <h3>Topic  3. Engage patients and families.</h3>
      <p><strong>Kerry Evers, Ph.D.</strong><br />
        There has been considerable discussion in the public health and chronic care  communities over the value of encouraging patients as active participants in  their health care. Doing so means creating a health information environment  that is supportive of patients' self-management goals, and is encouraging of  patients' efforts to live healthier lives. In this session, participants will  discuss the role of consumer facing informatics applications in encouraging  proactive involvement from patients and their families in health care.</p>
      <h3>Topic  4. Improve population and public health.</h3>
      <p><strong>Patricia Nolan, M.D., M.P.H.</strong><br />
        In the initial proposal to create a National Health Information Infrastructure,  the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics argued that a network of  interoperable, interconnected electronic health records could help dissolve the  barriers between patient monitoring and efforts to improve the health of  populations. This panel will consider the ways in which a national health  information infrastructure could be exploited to improve population health.</p>
      <h3>Topic  5. Ensure adequate privacy and security protections.</h3>
      <p><strong>Bettijoyce B. Lide</strong><br />
        Privacy and confidentiality issues will continue to collide with national goals  for health information sharing as technology specialists and advocacy groups  look for new and evolving solutions to that tension. In this working group,  participants will continue discussions begun earlier in the day on privacy and  security issues in a more detailed discussion of recommended solutions.</p>
      <h3>Topic  6. Diffusing technology-based health interventions.</h3>
      <p><strong>Abdul R. Shaikh, Ph.D., M.H.Sc. &amp; Cynthia Vinson, M.P.A.</strong><br />
        Following a meeting held in Rhode Island two years ago, the National Cancer  Institute has been working with a panel of specialists to develop solutions to  the diffusion of technology-based health research interventions. Session  attendees will share their own experience disseminating technology and discuss  a potential framework and process to help others succeed.</p>
      <h3>Topic  7. Delivering applications to people regardless of time or location.</h3>
      <p><strong>Tom Eng, V.M.D., M.P.H.</strong><br />
        Channels and strategies for delivering health information and behavioral  applications are changing rapidly, from PCs to mobile telephones and other  devices. In addition behavioral applications are increasingly being delivered  through newer technologies such as social networking and new media. This  working group will consider the challenges and opportunities of delivering  behavioral applications to people at critical moments regardless of time or  location.</p>
      <h3>Topic  8. Health 2.0.</h3>
      <p><strong>Matthew Holt &amp; Douglas Goldstein</strong><br />
        Shortly after the &quot;dot.com&quot; implosion weeded out the least successful  from the most successful Web applications, industry observer Tim O'Reilly  convened a panel of experts to discuss what the attributes of a second  generation Web (i.e., Web 2.0) might look like. Together, the group described a  collection of new approaches that emphasized (a) creating architectures for  participation, (b) enabling the formation of a &quot;collective  intelligence,&quot; and (c) utilizing data as the new &quot;Intel Inside&quot;  for applications. This working group will consider the viability of the Web 2.0  phenomenon as it is applied to health.</p>

      <h4>Special Supplement: Cyberinfrastructure for Consumer  Health</h4>
      <p>        On April 26, 2011, the nation's top behavioral  medicine, preventive medicine, and medical informatics societies held a media  briefing,&nbsp;Behavioral  Informatics for Health<em>,</em>&nbsp;to highlight two special journal issues  devoted to the topics of behavioral informatics for health and the  fast-evolving consumer and professional health IT landscape. A special  supplement to the&nbsp;<em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>&nbsp;(AJPM),  produced in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, titled  &quot;Cyberinfrastructure for Consumer Health&quot; was released at the media  briefing. Several articles from the issue are products of the&nbsp;<a href="http://informaticsforconsumerhealth.org/?q=about/2009-ich-summit">2009  Informatics for Consumer Health Summit</a>&nbsp;held in Potomac, MD, from which  this online initiative originated.</p>
