      <p>
        On behalf of the Informatics for Consumer Health  partnering organizations, welcome to InformaticsforConsumerHealth.org! This online resource aims to assist in the exchange of  ideas to bridge the gap between health care and information technology.</p>
      <p>InformaticsforConsumerHealth.org hopes to serve as a platform for communication  and collaboration among various stakeholders. Improvements in health care must  be built upon a foundation of enhanced communication and collaboration. Health  by its very nature is a collaborative enterprise. It can be influenced by the  ways in which consumers/patients and physicians communicate with each other; by  the ability or inability of physicians to share vital medical information  across offices in timely and reliable ways; and by the ability of consumers to  gain mastery over their own health through the support of employers, public  service organizations, government, and private industry. Health information  technology, or health informatics, will serve as the foundation for connecting  and enabling this collaborative community. But unless thought is given to the  ways in which stakeholders coordinate their efforts, consumers will be lost to  a cacophony of self-interest, indecipherable data, and conflicting messages.</p>
      <p>        For these reasons InformaticsForConsumerHealth.org  was developed to bring various stakeholders across sectors together and set a  path for coordination, quality, and future opportunity. Provided are the most  recent news and research to keep the community updated on evidence-based  innovations and products in-development, as well as funding and collaborative  opportunities available from a variety of sources. And most importantly,  invested communities, will be able to exchange ideas and access information  that will help empower providers and consumers to manage health care.</p>

        Program Director, <a href="/brp/hcirb/index.html">Health Communication  &amp; Informatics Research Branch</a><br />
        <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a></p>
      <p>        The National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s (NCI) Division  of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) is pleased to share our  recently issued challenge, <em><a href="http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/enabling-community-use-of-data-for-cancer-prevention-and-control/">Enabling  Community Use of Data for Cancer Prevention and Control</a>.</em> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> Associated  with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/open/plan">Community  Health Data Initiative</a> (CHDI), the challenge encourages  interdisciplinary teams of entrepreneurs, developers, and health scientists to  develop innovative applications that use publically available data, and build  upon the behavioral and communication science evidence-base, to deliver  population health data to communities to inform cancer prevention and control.</p>
      <p>        CHDI comes out of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive">2009  Open Government Directive</a>, which promotes the Administration's emphasis on  transparency, participation and collaboration in government, in sync with the  Web 2.0 zeitgeist of online information sharing and collaboration. The  ascendance of online platforms for communication and collaboration underscores  the need for HHS to better understand the online flow of information for health  communication. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2956229/">Health 2.0</a> can  be described as the translation/application of Web 2.0 to medicine and public  health, spawning discussion of concepts such as &quot;apomediaries&quot;  whereby traditional gatekeepers of information such as health professionals are  replaced by individuals in online networks who strive to provide the wisdom of  crowds (be it right or wrong). NCI is focused on staying abreast of such trends  in health informatics with conceptual frameworks such as the <a href="/brp/hcirb/popsci.html">PopSciGrid</a> and the <a href="/brp/research/gem.html">Grid  Enabled Measures Portal</a> that embrace the data-sharing and  collaborative potential of the Internet for cancer treatment, prevention and  control.</p>
      <p>        We were particularly excited to see HHS launch  the CHDI earlier this year because of its emphasis on catalyzing community  health &quot;data suppliers&quot; and &quot;data appliers&quot; to find  innovative ways to use health-related data for community impact. In a similar  vein our <a href="/index.html">Division</a> supports a  diverse portfolio of research on the science of communicating health-related  data. For instance, the <a href="/brp/archive/ceccr/index.html">NCI Centers  of Excellence in Cancer Communication Research</a> (CECCR) reflect the  Institute's recognition that effective communication can help narrow the gap  between bench-to-trench research discoveries and application for cancer  prevention and control. As the health 2.0 landscape continues to evolve, we're  excited not only to contribute to an initiative advancing evidence-based  research but use it to fuel innovation.<br />
        We are enthusiastic about the challenge and we  are hopeful that innovative entrepreneurs and health scientists will submit  creative applications for harmonizing and visualizing health-related data to  enable and incentivize communities to utilize cancer data. We look forward to  sharing the winning applications at the Hawaii International Conference on  System Sciences workshop: <em>Designing Community Health Systems:  Opportunities and Challenges in Communicating Data.</em></p>
      <p>        Thanks,<br />

<h2 id="mhealthsummit">The 2010 mHealth Summit: Bringing  the Major Stakeholders Together</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 11-01-2010<br />
        <strong>By: Audie Atienza, Ph.D.</strong><br />
        Scientific Advisor for Technology Partnerships at National Institutes of Health</p>
      <p>        The 2010 mHealth Summit (<a href="http://www.mhealthsummit.org/">www.mhealthsummit.org</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>; November 8-10,  2010 in Washington, DC) has developed into a major event for health IT.   The 2010 mHealth Summit is being hosted by the Foundation for the National  Institutes of Health (FNIH), in partnership with the National Institutes of  Health (NIH) and the mHealth Alliance (United Nations Foundation, Rockefeller  Foundation, Vodafone Foundation), with many sponsoring organizations. The  central theme of the Summit is examining the &ldquo;intersect between research,  technology, and policy&rdquo;.  As such, we have invited key stakeholders from  academia/research, government, industry, non-profit and international  organizations. When the 2010 mHealth Summit Executive Working Committee started  the process, never in our wildest dreams did we think we could develop such an  amazing agenda!</p>
      <p>The 2010 mHealth Summit has established an ALL-STAR line-up of keynote speakers  including Dr. Francis Collins (Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH)),  Bill Gates (Founder, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), Ted Turner (Founder,  United Nations Foundation), Dr. Carolyn Clancy (Director, Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality), Todd Park (CTO, Dept of Health and Human Services), Aneesh  Chopra (CTO, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy), Dr. Judith  Rodin (President, Rockefeller Foundation) and Dr. Julio Frenk (Dean, Harvard  School of Public Health). Like Wow!!</p><p>
        But wait, there&rsquo;s more…</p><p>
        High-level panel sessions with VERY distinguished speakers will delve into the  topics of Cross-Sectoral Perspectives, Future Visions, Comparative  Effectiveness Research, Lessons Learned Across the Globe, CEO/Executive  Perspectives, Privacy/Security, and Regulatory/Policy Issues.  Speakers in  these panels are all leaders in their respective fields and having them all  under one roof will be incredible!  For example, the Regulatory/Policy  panel will have representatives from the Federal Communications Commission,  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, HHS Office of the National Coordinator for  Health Information Technology, the European Commission, the Signapore Ministry  of Health, and the World Health Organization.  </p><p>
        Over 400 abstracts from 28 countries were submitted in response to the Call for  Presentations/Technology Demonstrations for the Summit.  Many NIH mHealth  Interest Group members graciously participated in the abstract review process  and I express my appreciation to each and every one of them.  The mHealth  Summit Executive Working Group selected 30 abstracts to be presented as oral  presentations during themed concurrent sessions, with a mix of United States  and International research selected for each session.  Furthermore, 150  abstracts were selected for poster presentations and 40 were selected for the  technology demonstration session.  </p><p>
        We anticipate 2,000 participants at the 2010 Summit from many different sectors  of the mHealth ecosystem. Exploring the state of the science in mHealth,  interacting with cool mobile tools, and engaging in unprecedented network  opportunities across different sectors… you do not want to miss the 2010  mHealth Summit!</p>

<h2 id="addressing">Addressing Health Literacy in the Digital Age</h2>
      <p>Posted on 01-03-2011<br />
        <strong>By: Jessica Mark, M.P.H., CPH</strong>, Health Communication  and ehealth Service Fellow</p><p>
        <strong>Linda Harris, Ph.D.</strong>,  Lead, Health Communication and ehealth Team<br />

        U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<br />
        Nearly  half of all American adults&mdash;90 million people&mdash;have difficulty understanding and  acting upon basic health information needed to make appropriate health  decisions.1</p>
        <p>          Low  health literacy has been linked to inappropriate use of preventive services and  screenings, higher rates of hospitalization, and poorer reported health status.2 As public and private institutions are  increasingly using the Internet and other technologies to streamline the  delivery of health information and services, another layer of complexity is  added to the skills required to effectively manage one&rsquo;s health. The  combination of low health literacy and low digital literacy together may be a  barrier to equitable health outcomes on the population level. The U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; Office of Disease Prevention and  Health Promotion (ODPHP) is involved in several initiatives to provide  leadership and guidance in improving both health literacy and digital literacy  across the nation.</p>
        <p>          As  more and more health information and services move online, health literacy in a  digital world requires consumers to not only find, evaluate, understand and use  health information; but also to understand and navigate the technology being  used. Improving health literacy is about much more than just simplifying words.  However, the broad-based application of evidence-based best practices in  user-centered design, Web design principles and clear writing together provide  a necessary foundation for progress. There must be a widespread movement to  provide health content, tools and resources online and in emerging digital  technologies that are more accessible to low health and digital literacy  populations.</p>
        <p>          Several  recent national policies and initiatives have brought attention to health and  digital literacy, and catalyzed the public health and consumer informatics  communities in addressing these issues. These initiatives include the recently  enacted health care reform legislation (Affordable Care Act); the <em>National  Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy;</em> and the recent formation of a federal  Interagency Digital Literacy Working Group.</p>
        <p>          The  Affordable Care Act (ACA) is at the forefront of the nation&rsquo;s domestic policy  agenda. The Institute of Medicine Roundtable on Health Literacy recently  convened a Health Literacy and Health Care Reform Workshop to discuss health  literacy provisions in the ACA. The ACA includes a number of windows of opportunity  for addressing health and digital literacy, including references to the  provision of quality patient information in both print and electronic media, as  well as improved nutrition labeling and design and presentation of prescription  label information.3 With regard to consumer health  informatics, the ACA also frequently prescribes the use of technology for  engaging the public in health-improving interactions.</p>
        <p><em>The National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy</em> identifies overarching goals and high priority strategies for  creating a health literate society. The vision to achieving this plan is  dependent on seven goals, including developing and disseminating health and  safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable. Implicit in  this goal is the need to make information accessible&mdash;regardless of internet  experience, comfort with technology and online search and navigation skills.</p>
        <p>          Finally,  the Interagency Digital Literacy Working Group is committed to spurring the  advancement of digital literacy across all age groups and stages of life. The  Working Group was established by The Subcommittee on Broadband of the National  Science and Technology Council&rsquo;s Committee on Technology. The Working Group is  planning the launch of an online resource to provide an archive of resources  related to improving digital literacy. This repository will include a coherent  collection of tightly related and relevant resources on digital literacy across  government agencies. The group is working to ensure that individual digital  literacy education is complemented by organizational and institutional shifts  toward Web design and content that better meets the needs of consumers.<br />
          One  way we aim to improve health and digital literacy via quality health  information and design is to provide best practice guidance to other  intermediary organizations with <em>Health Literacy Online: A guide to  writing and designing easy-to-use health Website s</em>. <em>Health  Literacy Online</em> is a  research-based how-to guide for creating health Website s and Web content for  the millions of Americans with limited literacy skills and limited experience  using the Web. The strategies in this guide complement accepted principles of  good Web design and thus have the potential to improve the online experience  for all users, regardless of literacy skills. The guide offers an overview of  how to deliver online health information that is actionable and engaging, create  a health Website  that's easy to use, and evaluate and improve a health Web  site with user-centered design.</p>
        <p>          The <em>Health  Literacy Online</em> guide  was developed through the course of the redesign of healthfinder.gov and its  Quick Guide to Healthy Living, a resource for actionable prevention and  wellness information and tools. 15 studies over a period of 4 years informed  the development of the Quick Guide and the redesign of healthfinder.gov  overall. More than 750 people aged 18 to 84 participated in these studies, and  special care was taken to recruit and test adults with limited literacy skills.  The Quick Guide and healthfinder.gov serve as a living example of the very  principles outlined in the <em>Health Literacy Online</em><em> </em>guide. Now, healthfinder.gov is  featured as the go-to prevention resource on healthcare.gov, continuing the  tradition of reaching those with low health literacy and limited Web skills.<br />
          The  guidelines espoused by <em>Health Literacy Online</em><em> </em>and embodied in the Quick Guide  to Healthy Living are now also being used as part of the criteria for judging  the myHealthyPeople Application Developer Challenge. The challenge, conducted  in collaboration with Health 2.0, will award prizes to successful mobile and/or  web applications that make it easy for stakeholders of Healthy People to keep  up with the initiative and combine related data in meaningful ways&mdash;within a  user-centered interface design.</p>
        <p>          We  hope to bridge the worlds of health literacy and digital literacy, and to  integrate these goals into the healthcare reform movement. We hope you will  join us in creating a more accessible digital environment that consumers of all  health and digital literacy levels can enjoy and use to support better health  decisions, and in empowering citizens to take control of their health&mdash;through  healthcare reform and beyond.</p>

        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
      <p>        Improving health literacy is a national public  health imperative. The January 3, 2011, blog posting on health literacy in the  digital age summarizes several initiatives and events that have propelled health  literacy improvement onto the national stage. The <a href="https://health.gov/communication/initiatives/health-literacy-action-plan.asp">National Action Plan  to Improve Health Literacy</a> is one of those initiatives and includes  seven goals and multiple strategies, many relevant to the consumer health  informatics research agenda. In particular, one goal includes strategies on  making health information and recommendations clear and actionable, and another  goal addresses the need for more research and evaluation, including ehealth  applications, to improve health literacy.</p>
      <p>        Health literacy research is supported in large  part by the program announcement from the National Institutes for Health  (NIH), <a href="https://obssr.od.nih.gov/ncis-health-literacy-research-portfolio-where-have-we-been-and-where-would-we-like-to-go/">Understanding  and Promoting Health Literacy</a>. The Agency for Healthcare Research and  Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also  participate in the program announcement. In addition to supporting research,  AHRQ created <a href="https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/page/LiteracyGuide_0.pdf" target="_blank">Accessible  Health Information Technology (IT) for Populations with Limited Literacy: A  Guide for Developers and Purchasers of Health IT</a>. (PDF) The combination of the  Action Plan, research projects, and the developers' and purchasers' guide  creates an opportunity for consumer health informatics researchers and  developers to join with their health literacy colleagues to create truly  accessible digital applications for consumers.</p>
      <p>        NIH-supported health literacy research projects  that directly involve informatics include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>computer-based       education and self-management for chronic diseases, e.g., An RCT to Reduce       Cardiopulmonary Re-Hospitalizations or Health Literacy, Technology       Acceptance, On-line Self Care: Understanding Teens</li>
        <li>Internet       access and information-seeking skills, e.g., Click to Connect: Improving       Health Literacy through Internet Literacy</li>
        <li>virtual       experiences of probabilities, e.g., Communicating Probabilities through       Interactive Computer Graphics</li>
        <li>effective       speech techniques for multimedia, e.g., Evaluation of Clear Speech to       Enhance Multimedia eHealth</li>
        <li>personally       controlled health records, e.g., Health Literacy and Information       Management in ADHD: Designing an Optimal Record</li>
        <li>patient       education in electronic health records, e.g., Promoting Health Literacy       for Newly Prescribed via the EMR</li>
        <li>computerized       tool to generate &quot;plain language,&quot; e.g., Improving Health Outcomes       through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each of these examples, investigators are  focused on populations with limited health literacy and one or more health  challenges. Technology is used as an intervention or part of a communication  strategy, such as spoken plain language or interactive graphics, to improve  understanding. The findings from these studies are useful not only for other  health literacy projects but also for informatics researchers and developers  who want to design applications for specific populations with limited health  literacy skills or address limited health literacy when they design and test  applications for mass markets.</p>
      <p>        Other non-technology health literacy studies  have insights for informatics researchers and developers. Several NIH funded  studies focus on special populations, such as teens or older adults, and their  health literacy skills. Understanding the differences in the two groups'  motivations to seek health information as well as their interest in different  presentation formats is valuable information for application development.  Several other studies examine how health literacy skills are measured. The  findings from these studies can help with specific data on health literacy  skills than the national data in the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006483">National  Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL)</a> and provide questionnaires and  other research instruments for informatics studies.</p>
      <p>        In addition to the <a href="https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/">Health Literacy Online guide</a> mentioned  in the <a href="#addressing">January  3 blog</a>, AHRQ's Developers' and Purchasers' Guide is a succinct summary of  key design principles that consider health literacy skills and type of  technology. This guidance can help researchers and developers systematically  assess their attention to health literacy issues. AHRQ also has an <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/hitbartp.html">evidence report on health IT  use by the elderly, chronically ill and underserved populations</a> that  summarizes the functions with the most positive effects. CDC has plain  language guidance that researchers and developers can use to create text and  graphics that are clear and accessible, and NIH has <a href="https://plainlanguage.nih.gov/CBTs/PlainLanguage/login.asp">plain language  tips</a> and other clear communication information.</p>
      <p>        The <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10883/chapter/1">Institute of Medicine  report on health literacy</a> explicitly made the point that designers of  health information and services must change their practices and use health  literacy principles to create more accessible products. Technology can be a  great asset to improved accessibility, comprehension, and health management  skills. Digital health information and services can provide freedom and control  when consumers and patients can use technology to manage their health when,  where and how they want. If digital information and services are too  jargon-filled or complex, however, technology becomes one more barrier for  consumers and patients to overcome. Consumer health informatics experts can  apply the insights from health literacy research and guidance to make sure that  digital health achieves its promise and avoids frustrating consumers or worse,  making them indifferent to e-health's benefits.</p>

<h2 id="informatics">Informatics for Consumer  Health: A Core Function for the National Library of Medicine</h2>
      <p>Posted on 02-02-2011 <br />
        <strong>Milton Corn, M.D.</strong><br />
        Deputy Director for Research and Education<br />
        Acting Director, Office of Health Information Programs and Development<br />
        National Library of Medicine<br />
        National Institutes of Health</p>
      <p>        The  National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library,  and the central focus of its mission is information: its collection, storage,  accessibility, and maximally efficient utilization. The Library has been a  pioneer in recognizing the value of information technology, and in the adoption  and development of informatics. NLM provides essential information and tools in  support of research by biologists and clinical researchers, but considers of  equal importance the needs of health care providers, and consumers, the twin  targets of the Informatics for Consumer Health initiative. A significant  fraction of NLM resources are dedicated to consumer informatics, which is an  important component of NLM's online resources, its intramural research, and its  grant and contract funding opportunities for the extramural community.</p>
      <p><em>Consumer Information</em> is  provided directly to millions by NLM through <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/">MedlinePlus</a>. Developed as the  National Institutes of Health's consumer-friendly website for patients and  their families and friends, it also has become a popular stop for clinicians  seeking basic information or a refresher about a broad variety of topics  relevant to health and disease. Conversely, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a>, another NLM database  comprising more than 20 million citations for biomedical literature and  intended primarily for professionals, is open to the public and receives much  use from those consumers who are undaunted by the jargon inevitable in  professional writing.<br />
        <em>Intramural Research</em> at NLM  also is centered on informatics and currently includes such consumer informatics  projects as decision support for clinicians, and personal health records for  consumers.</p>
      <p><em>Extramural Funding</em> from the  Library's grant and contract programs has long been an important source of  support for projects relevant to consumer informatics. Past programs include  telemedicine, awards to provide internet access to the underserved, and the  development of Web resources for consumers on such topics as mental health,  drug information, multiple sclerosis, and care of the elderly among others.</p>
      <p>        Current  grant programs continue to have biomedical informatics as a central element,  and can be utilized by those whose interest is consumer health informatics.</p>
      <p>        NLM  offers a broad spectrum of grant opportunities including traditional NIH  research awards for investigator-originated ideas or for announced themes of  interest to NIH such as literacy or behavior, resource awards for online  information sources, training in informatics, conference awards, and support  for small businesses.</p>
      <p>        Research  Support is available as R01 awards. Suitable research topics among others are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visualization and presentation       approaches for information: e.g., to enhance decisions, learning or       understanding, including intelligent agents, customizable interfaces</li>
        <li>Analysis and evaluation of       information needs for and uses of online health-related information</li>
        <li>Innovative applications of       simulation, user customization, virtual environments or innovative       information integration techniques to enhance or improve learning and       retention in biomedical and health education</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example  award: Improving access to multi-lingual health information through machine  translation</h3>
      <p>Exploratory/Developmental  Grants (R21) for Biomedical Informatics and Bioinformatics are also offered in  support of early stage conceptual work and feasibility tests in biomedical  informatics. These studies may involve considerable risk but may lead to a  breakthrough in a particular area, or to the development of novel techniques or  approaches that could have major impact on a field of biomedical, behavioral,  or clinical research. Preliminary data are not required, but applicants are  urged to provide milestones by which progress on the project can be measured.  Topics of interest include the same themes described above for R01 projects.</p>
      <h3>Example  award: eHealth Literacy Barriers and Solutions for Consumer Use of a Health  Portal</h3>
      <p>NLM  also participates in a number of NIH multi-Institute research initiatives.  Among such are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding       and Promoting Health Literacy Grants (R01 and R21)</strong> Support to       encourage empirical research on health literacy concepts, theory and       interventions</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral and       Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities       Grants (R01 and R21)</strong> Support for       informatics-centric projects relevant to behavioral and social science       research on the causes and solutions to health and disability disparities       in the U.S. population</li>
        <li><strong>NIH Basic       Behavioral and Social Sciences Opportunity Network (OppNET) Grants</strong> NLM's interests       focus on novel informatics approaches needed to capture, represent,       organize, analyze or integrate research findings related to social and       behavioral science priorities of OppNet</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Resource  grants differ from research grants, and are designed to improve the  dissemination, management and use of biomedical knowledge. These applications  are judged during review by criteria other than those used for research  applications. Applications must address the theme(s) selected and described by  NLM in the annual announcement, which in 2010 offered support for projects to  bring useful health information to health disparity populations and their  health care providers.</p>
      <h3>Example  award: A Multiethnic Digital Corpus of Speech for Older Persons</h3>
      <p>NLM  supports training of informaticians to assure an adequate national pool of  informatics researchers and health information specialists. Training is offered  at eighteen NLM programs across the nation, and through individual fellowships.  Approximately half of the trainees supported by NLM pursue careers in areas  relevant to consumer health informatics.<br />
        Conference  Support (R13) is available for scientific meetings, conferences, and workshops  that are relevant to scientific development in biomedical informatics,  bioinformatics, computational biology, and information sciences. If  sufficiently open and of general use, conferences relevant to consumer health  informatics are eligible to apply.<br />
        Small  businesses with business ideas grounded in informatics can apply to NLM's Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research  (STTR) grants programs. Recent areas of interest to NLM have included the  Semantic Web, and Intelligent Search Agents, but any topic, including consumer  health, relevant to the NLM mission is suitable for these grants.</p>
      <h3>Example  Award: Bayesian Textual and Multimedia Information Retrieval</h3>
      <p>NLM  has no control over the federal budget to dictate how much funding is available  from year to year, but clearly, informatics is at the heart of our grant  programs; awards relevant to consumer health constitute a substantial portion  of our portfolio. Decades of support for electronic health records exemplify  NLM's interest in applying information technology to support both those who  provide care and those who receive care. Current problems of particular  interest include: research, development and application of appropriate decision  support needed to exploit efficiently the current federal push to implement  electronic records widely; better understanding of how to influence behavior  with information; and improving accessibility of the public to health  information of high quality in a cultural climate in which information is  easily available but often anecdotal, commercially motivated, or otherwise of  dubious authenticity.</p>
      <p>        Detailed  information about NLM's grant programs can be found at <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/</a>.  The site can be especially useful for those not familiar with NLM programs or  NIH procedures because it includes contact information for NLM program officers  who can answer questions and guide applicants. The site provides, as well, a  list of awards in each grant category, a useful resource for those uncertain  about the type of projects NLM will fund.</p>

      <p>        Recently, members from the Behavioral Research  Program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) presented a workshop at the  annual conference for the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco entitled  &quot;Behavioral Informatics for Tobacco Control: Opportunities and Challenges  for Research, Policy, and Communication of Data.&quot; The presentations  largely focused on health-oriented behavioral and social science in the era of  &quot;Big Data.&quot; That is, an era when easily accessible data can be  measured in petabytes (one quadrillion bytes, 1000 terabytes, one million  gigabytes), an amount of data that is truly impossible for most of us to grasp.  A key question within the field of health and health research is how do we  meaningfully shift though and integrate this vast amount of data such that we  can identify unexpected patterns and findings that allow us to better inform  our science and improve health?</p>
      <p>        Within this context, two innovative NCI  initiatives were used to highlight key points. The <a href="/brp/hcirb/index.html">Population  Science Grid</a> Community Health Data Portal (PopSciGrid) is an evolving  proof-of-concept for communication and harmonization of health-related data for  consumers and policy-makers. The goal of this project is to visualize  behavioral and other types of publicly available data using analytic tools and  graphics for community impact. Closely linked to this effort is the <a href="/brp/research/gem.html">Grid Enabled Measures</a> (GEM)  project. This project has created a platform that is designed to facilitate the  development of an online community of scientists to collaborate on two goals:  1) identify, vet, and promote the use of standardized behavioral and social  science measures, especially those which are based on theoretically-meaningful  constructs, and 2) use these standardized measures to assist in sharing and  harmonization of data. Although the workshop presentations focused on these two  initiatives, these ultimately served as jumping off points for the discussion  of much broader themes, which I would like to take a few moments to consider.</p>
      <p>        As a general comment, I was struck by how  fundamental concerns about the changing landscape of data continue to be  unresolved for many of the workshop participants. Of course the  &quot;sample&quot; was skewed toward people who were not familiar with topics  associated with Big Data and the growing movement toward the democratization of  data, otherwise why would you attend the workshop? Still, my sense is that  there is a growing tension within behavioral and social science communities  (and probably beyond) that is not being acknowledged, let alone addressed. On  the one side, there are the health information technology (HIT) techies who are  fully embracing the use of emerging technologies to better understand health  issues and are forging ahead as fast as budgets and technology limitations will  allow. The enthusiasm and energy of these folks practically crackles in the air  around them. On the other side of this widening data chasm is a large, and I  would suggest often forgotten, contingent of health researchers and  administrators. The downside of the growing enthusiasm for health informatics  is that the concerns (and by that I mean fears) of the people who create,  collect, and hold most of the data are not being addressed to the extent that  they should.</p>
      <p>        Although for different reasons, both these  groups have long-standing histories of fiercely protecting data access,  maintaining tight control over assessment instruments, and a predilection for  developing scales relevant to their own work and projects. If we step back and  consider the contextual forces that helped to shape this approach to the  development of assessment instruments, data collection and management, and  indeed research itself, (e.g., publish or perish, IRB concerns, HIPPA and other  privacy issues, limited access to others&rsquo; assessment instruments, a general  complete lack of access to others&rsquo; data) this world view makes a great deal of  sense. We need to remember that these are professionals who have  achieved, or are desperately trying to achieve, success in their  careers by carefully crafting arguments that support a line of research based  on the thoughtful consideration of what their data &quot;means.&quot; They  immerse themselves in the data and protect against people who may misunderstand  this meaning. This can be the case of data collected within a single lab using  freshmen psychology students, a state public health project, or a national  initiative. My experience has been that discussions about data sharing and  harmonization universally elicit fear among these folks.</p>
      <p>        I recognize that this is a smidge overstated,  but I encourage those of us in HIT, especially those interested in large scale  efforts to facilitate data sharing and the democratization of data, to pause  and consider where the &quot;owners&quot; of much of this data are coming from,  and to recognize that their professional reality needs to be taken into  consideration.</p>
      <p>        I must confess that I have been guilty of not  really listening to what these people are saying. Mostly I have rolled my eyes  (at least internally) and made some sort of dismissive blanket statement about  how the gates have already been opened and our data is no longer ours. After  now having made this type of statement to a variety of groups several times, it  has finally dawned on me that my doing so is a disservice to both those on the  other side of the chasm and in the open data camp.</p>
      <p>        I want to suggest that concerted efforts need to  be made to educate and engage those on the other side of the data chasm. We  need to spend more time cultivating relationships with those not on the bus,  singing in the choir, who have not drunk the Kool-Aid, or whatever your  favorite metaphor may be.</p>
      <p>        So given this, let me spend my last few minutes  discussing what I perceive as the main concern: misuse of the data. This takes  a few forms. First, that someone, typically the general public, will  misunderstand the data and draw false conclusions that are then propagated into  the universe. Second, people will analyze the data differently, whether on  purpose or due to a lack of knowledge regarding the data structure, and then  &quot;publish&quot; the results in some form outside of the peer review  process. Third, the data will be used by some entity to promote an agenda that  in turn hurts public health efforts. (This latter concern is the one that  seems to draw the most intense anxiety, especially when the data is  health-related.) This might take the form of discrediting existing health  programs, questioning programs&rsquo; value and impact, and/or denying that the data  supports the link between a health outcome and a given exposure or behavior.  These fears are especially evident in contexts where program funding is in  jeopardy or there are large and litigious stakeholders (e.g., an industry whose  product has been linked to a negative health outcome).</p>
      <p>        These fears are legitimate but at the same time,  the open data movement is rolling and cannot be turned back. Not addressing  these fears may serve to hinder efforts to move forward. Thus a major challenge  we must directly address in our efforts to bridge the data chasm is how can  these issues be dealt with given that those who have historically been able to  tightly control their data will not be able to effectively do so for much  longer? It is my hope that those active in the democratization of data will  work with the gatekeepers and owners of data to tackle this head-on. Rather  than proclaiming that if they want to run with the big dogs then they need to  leave the puppies on the porch, I suggest that the answers lie in cooperation  on developing methods of structuring data and providing user friendly data  management/analysis tools to reduce misunderstandings by lay users and truly  provide a means for the data to reach its potential to inform and guide us in  our efforts to improve health at local, state, national, and international  levels.</p>

      <h3>SXSW  Interactive Panel&mdash;Minority Report: Social Media for Decreasing Health  Disparities</h3>
      <p>SXSW  Interactive, a &quot;launching pad for new creative content&quot;, is happening  this weekend (March 11–15) in Austin, TX. While most music and film enthusiasts  have known this venue for a long time, a third part of SXSW, the <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/">Interactive</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>  may not be familiar to many communication and public health folks. For me, it  was only after I received the invitation to present that I began learning about  the exciting program. It promises to be an energizing gathering place of  creative minds from different sectors including the technology industry,  academics and government. Among the many technological innovations that have  taken place at SXSW, I learned this is where Twitter was instantly transformed  into a communication phenomenon several years ago.</p>
      <p>        I  will be participating on a panel entitled <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/sxsw/scqcx/">Minority Report: Social Media for  Decreasing Health Disparities</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> on  Sunday, March 13. My presentation will discuss the potentials to harness the  power of social media to address health inequities. I will begin by discussing  the key characteristics of social media and highlighting some of the latest  data from national surveys, including NCI's <a href="https://hints.cancer.gov/">HINTS</a> survey  and the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/">PEW</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> reports.  In the discourse surrounding the digital divide and health disparities, it is  notable that two opposing views (both with supporting data) dominate the  discussion. On the one hand, the ubiquitous and participative nature of social  media has enabled more equitable access to health information, therefore  potentially decreasing disparities. On the other hand, we know that the digital  divide persists and unequal access to quality care and support continues to  further alienate many communities. With these observations, I will discuss  where I see the key and top-priority research questions lie as well as  measurement methods and potential implementation plans to make sure the  interventions are relatable in real-world settings.</p>
      <p>        As  a side note, I was also told that sandals and maybe shorts will do on the panel  presentations. It will be a refreshing change from the mostly uptight  scientific conferences we are used to. I look forward to this event and sharing  my thoughts when I return.<br />

<h2 id="insights">Insights in Funding:  National Science Foundation</h2>
      <p>Posted on 03-16-2011<br />

      <p>        (Some  of the content has been taken from an article entitled <strong>&quot;Cyber-enabled  Research at the National Science Foundation: Pushing the Boundaries of  Transdisciplinary Science&quot;</strong> by the same authors, in the American  Journal of Preventive Medicine, upcoming  special supplement in Cyberinfrastructure for Consumer  Health in April  2011.)</p>
      <h3>An  Introduction to NSF</h3>
      <p>The  National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent federal agency, was created  by Congress in 1950. With an annual budget of about $6.9 billion (FY 2010), NSF  is the funding source for approximately 20 percent of all federally supported basic  research conducted by America's colleges and universities, plus some non-profit  organizations. In fields such as mathematics, computer science, and the social  and behavioral sciences, NSF is the major source of federal funding.</p>
      <p>        The  NSF is divided into the following seven directorates that support science and  engineering research and education: Biological Sciences (BIO); Computer and  Information Science and Engineering (CISE); Geosciences (GEO); Mathematics and  Physical Sciences (MPS); Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE);  Engineering (ENG); and Education and Human Resources (EHR). <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/staff/orgchart.jsp">Each directorate is further  subdivided into divisions, and typically, divisions are further divided into  programs</a>.</p>
      <p>        NSF  uses two general review criteria for all proposals: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/#facts"><em>Intellectual Merit</em> and <em>Broader Impacts</em></a>.  Under intellectual merit, reviewers are asked to comment on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How important       is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within       its own field or across different fields?</li>
        <li>How well       qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If       appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of prior work.)</li>
        <li>To what extent       does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially       transformative concepts?</li>
        <li>How well       conceived and organized is the proposed activity?</li>
        <li>Is there       sufficient access to resources?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For  broader impacts, reviewers are asked to address:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How well does the activity       advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training,       and learning?</li>
        <li>How well does the proposed       activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g.,       gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)?</li>
        <li>To what extent will it enhance       the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities,       instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?</li>
        <li>Will the results be disseminated       broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding?</li>
        <li>What may be the benefits of the       proposed activity to society?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Prospective  investigators should consult both a program's solicitation (advertised on the  web pages of various divisions and programs) and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp">NSF's <em>Proposal  and Award Policies and Procedures Guide</em></a> when preparing proposals; they can  also consult with NSF Program Directors in the appropriate programs. NSF's web  site&mdash;<a href="https://www.nsf.gov">www.nsf.gov</a>&mdash;has a lot of information and  is relatively easy to navigate.</p>
      <h3>Support  of Health-related Research</h3>
      <p>NSF  funds a significant amount of health-related research. Such funding  opportunities are spread throughout the Foundation, and <strong>are  sometimes embedded within programs in various fields that do NOT mention the  word &quot;health&quot; in their title</strong>. This is important to  realize when perusing NSF solicitations. For example, one of the  Foundation-wide multi-disciplinary programs that can accommodate health-related  research is the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503163">Cyber-enabled  Discovery and Innovation</a> (CDI)  program. The CDI solicitation does not explicitly mention health. Instead, the  solicitation notes, &quot;Collectively, CDI research outcomes are expected to  produce paradigm shifts in our understanding of a wide range of science and  engineering phenomena and socio-technical innovations that create new wealth  and enhance the national quality of life.&quot; Yet, &quot;national quality of  life&quot; clearly includes health-related research, and consumer health  informatics would be a part of that. It is important that people searching for  funding opportunities at NSF read the program solicitations carefully and in  detail to determine whether their project will fit into the program.</p>
      <p>        In  addition to special initiatives, many long-standing, established programs throughout  NSF also fund research that simultaneously fosters innovation and basic  research in a particular field and advances national health.<br />
        A  few examples of current NSF projects* that address health-related research  include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.eldertech.missouri.edu/">Center for Eldercare and       Rehabilitation Technology</a>, University of Missouri, Columbia is an       example of NSF support for cyber-enabled team science. It is funded under       a joint program by Engineering and Computer Science called Cyber Physical       Systems (CPS). The Center has six active projects, which are funded by the       NSF, NIH, and other funding agencies. One of the projects: &quot;Active       Heterogeneous Sensing for Fall Detection and Fall Risk Assessment&quot;       (funded under the CPS award #0931607) investigates adaptive sensor fusion       and intelligent decision making technologies to monitor and detect when       older adults fall in their home environment.</li>
        <li>A recent NSF       award (CDI award #1028076) uses machine learning and pattern recognition       to analyze children's behavioral cues to try to predict which children       will develop psychiatric disorders (or not). This project builds on       behavioral science findings that demonstrate how psychiatric disorders are       culminated by behaviors that can be observed, learned, and correlated. It       uses modern computational tools to develop new methods of diagnosis and       intervention.</li>
        <li>Another example       is the project funded from the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences       (SBE) Directorate, from the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES),       entitled &quot;Legal and Insurance Environments Impact and Health       Practices<strong> </strong>(SES award       #0958190). This research examines the effects of medical malpractice       suits, tort laws, health insurance, and reproductive regulations on the       rates of cesarean sections in the United States.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A  New Initiative: Smart Health and Wellbeing</h3>
      <p>In  2010, the CISE Directorate announced a program named <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503556">Smart Health and  Wellbeing</a> (SHW). The goal of  the Smart Health and Wellbeing program is to seek improvements in safe,  effective, efficient, equitable, and patient-centered health and wellness  services through innovations in computer and information science and  engineering. Doing so requires leveraging the scientific methods and knowledge  bases of a broad range of computing and communication research perspectives.  NSF also has a Working Group dedicated to Smart Health, which meets regularly  to coordinate and foster activities at the Foundation level.</p>
      <p>        As  one effort to discuss international efforts and analyze new directions in  health informatics, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  [OECD] and NSF organized a workshop, held in February of this year. The  workshop, called &quot;Building a Smarter Health and Wellness Future,&quot;  highlighted how different countries are using smart health to support aging  populations, develop electronic patient records, use mobile devices to gather  research data, and the like. More information, including a link to the OECD-NSF  workshop agenda, can be found at: <a href="http://www.oecd.org/internet/ieconomy/oecd-nsfworkshopbuildingasmarterhealthandwellnessfuture.htm">http://www.oecd.org/internet/ieconomy/oecd-nsfworkshopbuildingasmarterhealthandwellnessfuture.htm</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>  A detailed summary of the workshop is available at the <a href="http://www.cccblog.org/2011/03/03/recapping-the-recent-oecd-nsf-workshop-on-smart-health/">Computing  Community Consortium's blog.</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a></p>
      <p>        NSF  has many different avenues to accommodate scientific research for healthcare  and related issues. There is a wealth of opportunities that directly relate to  innovation in informatics for consumer health. Interested persons should  explore the agency's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov">website</a> to find appropriate programs and NSF  staff contact information.</p>

<h2 id="provider">Provider-Centric Data Exchange or  Patient-Centric Care--When will we get to Meaningful Impact?</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 03-24-2011<br />

        <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/solutions/health-care">HealthyCircles&trade;; LLC</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a></p>
      <p>        The difference between <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/how-attain-meaningful-use">meaningful  use</a> and meaningful impact became very clear to me during the  completion of a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded-research study on Primary  Care Physicians, HIT and Quality Improvement Activities.  The Chief Medical Officer of a large physician practice summed up the bottom  line in a few words, <em>&quot;None of this will matter, if it doesn't help  us take better care of patients.&quot;</em> That was it. He challenged  policy makers and technology vendors to keep focused on what matters  most&mdash;creating incentives that spur the development of innovative technologies  that enhance the ability of professionals to provide patient-centric care.<br />
        Unfortunately, our focus has often been  provider-centric and only focused on data-exchange between the traditional  hospital and physician-practice setting. There has yet to emerge a consensus  response to two fundamental questions: &quot;Where is the patient in all of  this?&quot; and &quot;How can we improve outcomes unless all professionals who  actively participate in care are connected?&quot;. We know that patients and  families see the value of sharing information as well. A recent survey by the  Markle Foundation revealed that roughly 80 percent of both the public and  doctors agree that it is important to require participating hospitals and  doctors to share information to better coordinate care, cut unnecessary costs,  and reduce medical errors.  So, where is the common ground? It resides in the 2015 goals for the meaningful  use of Health Information Technology:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engage Patients and Families</li>
        <li>Improve Care Coordination</li>
        <li>Improve quality, safety, efficiency and reduce health       disparities</li>
        <li>Ensure adequate privacy and security protections for       personal health information</li>
        <li>Interoperability with health information systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, the path forward is clear. Health  information technology must support collaboration across the technological,  organizational and geographic boundaries that separate healthcare  professionals, patients and families. The endeavor will only be successful when  every individual who contributes to the care team is included, and when  patients and family members are equal participants in information exchange. So,  how is this being accomplished?</p>
      <p>        In the public sector, the Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA) sponsored Patient Safety and Clinical Pharmacy  Collaborative has  successfully shown the value of integrating evidence-based clinical pharmacy  services into the care and management of high-risk, high-cost, complex patients  in over 128 sites that span 43 states. By including clinical pharmacists on the  team and focusing on sharing pharmacy data at the point of care, they have  successfully improved quality, optimized efficacy and implemented a model for  minimize the risk of adverse events. Efforts are currently underway to  strengthen the infrastructure that will enable this model to become sustainable  and scalable.</p>
      <p>        In the private sector, organizations are using  integrated health solutions such as the HealthyCircles Connected Care Platform  to accomplish the virtual integration of pharmacy services into the care  delivery process. This virtual integration of services is a cost-effective strategy  as it provides access to the record sharing information system that connects  patients, families, and health care professionals through secure social  networking technology.</p>
      <p> For example, a subset of patients undergoing  treatment for specific conditions that require specialty pharmacy services  (e.g., oncology, home-infusion) are registered on the HealthyCircles platform  and receive access to a robust personal health record. The patients are  encouraged to invite a family caregiver(s) to participate actively in their  care. At the same time, prescribing professionals are invited to access the  shared record and to utilize the clinical tools available via the professional  portal. This connectivity simplifies the administrative processes around  procurement of these medications and frees the patient and their family from  needless complexity. On the clinical side, physicians can track their patients'  progress and modify treatment plans as necessary based upon the patient's  feedback captured in daily health programs, and intermittent assessments. In  addition, the prescribing physicians and other professionals can now coordinate  care with the insurer and specialty pharmacy professionals as they participate  jointly in medication review, share lab results, and message patients in a  cost-effective manner. A connected health platform like HealthyCircles enables  the organization to deliver evidence-driven care, to improve access and to  drive cost-savings through more efficient care.</p>
      <p> If Health Information Technology is to have a  meaningful impact, only one question will define our success. Did it help us to  take better care of more patients at a dramatically reduced cost? We know that  information technology has effectively enabled significant cost savings and  efficiencies across many industries. What remains to be seen is if the paradox  of technology driving costs up in healthcare will be broken this time. Richard  Foster, the Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in  his testimony before the House Budget Committee on January 27, 2011 when  asked about the value of technology responded,<br />
        &quot;If there's a way to turn around the mindset for the people  who do the research and development … to get them to focus more on  cost-reducing tech and less on cost increasing technology, if you can do that  then one of biggest components of [increasing costs] turns to your side. Let's  hope that the meaningful use standards accomplish this focus.&quot;</p>
      <p>        Let's not just hope, but commit, to developing  and adopting technology that has a meaningful impact on the quality of care we  deliver.</p>

<p>        I recently attended the <a href="http://www.health2con.com/conferences/san-diego-2011/">Health 2.0 'Spring  Fling' Conference</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> in San Diego on March 22nd and immersed myself in  the vibe of this energetic, eclectic group of leaders, developers, and  entrepreneurs focused on innovating and leveraging the next generation of  online and mobile technologies for the health of individuals and populations.</p>
      <p>        I know it sounds like a commercial, both cheesy  and idealistic (which is also how my friends might describe me), but that last  bit in particular is important. More than once I heard the phrase 'Public  Health 2.0' being used to describe the proceedings. The folks at Health  2.0, be they from academia, non-profit, the commercial sector, or government,  are looking beyond the socio-technological innovation of new technologies and  platforms to explore how these tools and trends might be used in public health  to prevent disease, improve quality of life, and promote community health. As  an earnest public health informatician, I give kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/@bluetopaz">Indu</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/@boltyboy">Matt</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> and the Health 2.0 team for  encouraging discourse beyond the realm of clinical informatics to the broader  determinants of public health!<br />
        At the conference, I had the pleasure of  participating in The Health 2.0 Developer Challenge Showcase to announce the  first round of winners in 2011. All of the apps presented by the winning teams  were very cool, with one of the standouts being the community indicator  dashboard developed by the <a href="http://www.healthycommunitiesinstitute.com/">Healthy Communities Institute</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> for  the HHS myHealthyPeople Challenge. This app aggregates and presents broad  swathes of population health data to help enable community action for public  health. Another great app was FoodSwapper, developed by UsableHealth for the American Heart Association's Food Find  Challenge, which provides tailored healthy food recommendations to consumers.</p>
      <p>        I was particularly pleased to recognize the two  winners of NCI's own Developer Challenge for <a href="http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/enabling-community-use-of-data-for-cancer-prevention-and-control/">Enabling  Community Use of Data for Cancer Prevention and Control</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> Although, I  felt like the runt of the litter beside my esteemed colleagues, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/howard-koh/">Dr. Howard Koh,</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>Assistant  Secretary for Health, and <a href="https://twitter.com/@todd_park">Todd  Park</a>, Chief Technology Officer from the United States Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), I was proud nonetheless. The winners of NCI's  Developer Challenge were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Charlene Caburnay and the Health Communication Research       Laboratory at the Washington University in St. Louis for developing <a href="http://hcrlweb.gwb.wustl.edu/ozioma/"><strong>Ozioma</strong></a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>,       an innovative application that provides tailored, locally-relevant cancer       information to enhance the relevance of health-related news stories.</li>
        <li>Tarek Rashed and GSAREH for developing a geo-spatial       visualization tool called <strong>Geographic       Awareness of Cancer</strong> that integrates complex national and       regional cancer-related data into snazzy and easy to play with maps,       tables, and charts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Charlene and Tarek joined us at the January 2011  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences to present their apps in a  special symposium on <a href="http://shidler.hawaii.edu/news/itm/2015/08/13/upcoming-hicss-49-at-grand-hyatt-kauai-jan-5-8-2016-hicssorghicss_44/44swt/agenda-phi.pdf" target="_blank">Cyberinfrastructure  for Public Health Impact</a>. (PDF) Congratulations to both of our winners, and  thank you to all the entrants who channeled their passion, innovation, and hard  work into developing apps in partnership with HHS and Health 2.0 Developer  Challenge.<br />
        Stay tuned for news about our upcoming developer  challenge that will attempt to take the notion of utilizing data for public  health impact to the next level. Until then, I'd like to crowdsource a  couple of related issues that we're tackling at NCI:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What do you see as a key problem/challenge for  the research and/or practice of cancer prevention and control that might be  addressed with innovative technology?</li>
        <li>How can we bring behavioral medicine and health  communication scientists together with developers and entrepreneurs to innovate  with high quality data to improve public health?</li>
      </ul>

<h2 id="coming">The Coming of Age of Behavioral  Informatics: Thoughts on Next Week's National Press Club Event</h2>

      <p>Posted on 04-20-2011<br />
        <strong><a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=16802269&amp;bioType=stf">David K. Ahern, Ph.D.</a></strong><br />

      <p>        I've come to realize that patience is a virtue  and absolutely required in science and technology. Over 25 years ago my  colleague Lee Baer from Massachusetts General Hospital and I imagined that  patients would someday have handheld devices that could enable and support  self-management, and there would be a desire and need for programs, namely  &quot;apps&quot;, to take advantage of them. We were working on a program  we called &quot;Confidant&quot; using HyperCard programming language for  cognitive behavior therapy of negative thoughts. I remember coming up with a  &quot;window&quot; metaphor for a view into one's private thoughts and Lee  cleverly thought of and rendered the smashing of the window with a hammer as a  way to eradicate the thought. It was pretty cool stuff then. We couldn't  even imagine the capabilities of the iPhone and other mobile devices today that  readily deliver compelling graphics, video and texting in real time.</p>
      <p>        Fast forward to 2011 and we are witness to the  coming of age of behavioral and consumer informatics.  On Tuesday April  26th the Society of Behavioral Medicine and the American Medical Informatics  Association along with other leading groups will host an event, <em>Behavioral Informatics for  Health</em>, at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. to highlight the  publication of two journal issues that focus on behavioral and consumer  informatics. Replete with original research, editorials and opinion  pieces, the articles in these two journals reflect how far we have come since  those early days- pre internet and smartphones. But what is most  gratifying is the <em>integration</em> of behavioral science,  behavioral medicine, and informatics that has occurred over this time.</p>
      <p>        We have come very far but have yet to see the  full promise and potential of the marriage of behavioral science and  technology. What do you think the future holds in this arena? Can we  deliver evidenced-based interventions using technology on a large  scale? Will these eHealth tools and resources improve quality and  constrain costs?</p>

<h2 id="methodological">Methodological  Considerations in Analyzing Social Media Data</h2>
      <p>Posted on 05-02-2011<br />
        <strong>Karley Abramson, M.P.H.</strong><br />
        Cancer Research Training Award Fellow<br />
  <strong>Wen-ying Sylvia Chou, Ph.D., M.P.H.</strong><br />
        Program Director<br />
        Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch<br />
        National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health</p>
      <p>        One  of our current priorities in the National Cancer Institute's Health  Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) is to understand the ways  social media are used for cancer prevention and control in order to inform  effective programs and interventions. This effort requires deeper insight  into the naturally-occurring activity that takes place on social media  sites. In a project researching Facebook interactions about breast cancer,  we encountered many methodological decision points that we'd like to discuss.<br />
        We  chose to focus on Facebook pages concerning breast cancer awareness because of  its high visibility in the media (including social media), and also because it  combines our interests: Sylvia has substantial quantitative and  qualitative research experience in social media for health communication, while  Karley, a &quot;Facebook native&quot;, brings multiple perspectives as a public  health researcher and a Facebook participant. Our project attempts to  answer the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How are  non-profit organizations using Facebook pages to promote breast cancer  awareness, and what kinds of content are they posting?</li>
        <li>How do  users interact with each other and with the organization? Where on the page do  people 'gather' and talk?</li>
        <li>What are  the main functions of Facebook posts from users and the organizations hosting  the pages?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We  encountered methodological questions from the onset. In addition to the massive  amount of information being exchanged, Facebook interactions are highly  unstructured and minimally moderated, posing significant challenges to coding  research. The variation in user intent and participation creates an open  space suitable for an endless range of communication and interaction.</p>
      <h3>Methodological  challenges and our decisions:</h3>
      <h4><em>Defining our data</em></h4>
      <p>Our  first task was to narrow down the available content into relevant and  analyzable data.  We considered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The number of       pages/organizations to include.</li>
        <li>The depth and       detail ofanalysis on each page.</li>
        <li>Which areas or       sections of the page to analyze (Wall, Discussion board, Pictures, etc.).</li>
        <li>The time-frame.</li>
        <li>Criteria for       determining the importance of the pages (notability, popularity,       intentions/goals of pages, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After  consideration of the abundance of pages dedicated to breast cancer, we decided  to focus our analysis to a case-study of one page and examine the content of  the Wall posts during October of 2010 (Breast Cancer Awareness Month), the  month of the year when the sites are most active.  We chose one particular  page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BreastCancerAwareness?ref=ts">Breast  Cancer Awareness</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>) based on membership totals, indicated by the number of  &quot;likes&quot; or &quot;fans&quot; for each page, and the stated intentions  of the organization for awareness.</p>
      <h4><em>To code, or not to code?</em></h4>
      <p>Our  next obstacle was to decide how to best describe and analyze the data.  We  encountered numerous challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overlapping functions of posts: many       comments and responses serve multiple purposes.</li>
        <li>Difficulties in disentangling       &quot;push&quot; messages from &quot;pull&quot; messages.</li>
        <li>Inexhaustible range of topics       that extend beyond breast cancer.</li>
        <li>Unpredictable patterns of       conversation and user exchange.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As  we became more engaged in this research, we realized that traditional methods  of qualitative research couldn't adequately capture the multi-dimensional  interactions that occur in social media formats.  We would need to devise  an innovative way to analyze, organize, and present the data without subjecting  it to the restrictions of a traditional coding analysis.</p>
      <h4><em>Going with the (data) flow</em></h4>
      <p>To  say the least, we are hardly starved for data, and as expected, we must address  the difficulty in creating a conceptual framework that can adequately account  for all of the activity and interaction that occurs on these pages. The  democratic user participation creates content that is layered with multiple  meanings, connotations, and intentions, and we find ourselves ideating  &quot;big picture&quot; findings and restructuring them into more concrete,  codable results. This study suggests to us that when the goal is to  describe Facebook content and user activities, a bottom-up approach is more  appropriate. For instance, we have found that organization-generated posts  often serve multiple purposes that extend beyond their original intentions. In  one example, Breast Cancer Awareness (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BreastCancerAwareness?ref=ts">BCA</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>) posts a  message about a new product (Pink Ribbon pants) and encourages users to make  purchases to help fund mammograms for women in need.  Users are then free  to respond in any manner they choose. In this instance, users take over the  space and begin a conversation about where to find affordable  mammograms. Another user exploits this same space to promote their  products (to support ovarian cancer research). This example demonstrates  the unsystematic nature of Facebook interactions, and illustrates how  conversations can occur in unpredictable locations.</p>
      <h3>What's  Next?</h3>
      <p>Developing  research methodologies needed for this form of media will require creativity,  flexibility, and a willingness to re-conceptualize the meaning of health  communication. Once we have developed and advance our understanding of social  media as a communication phenomenon, social media-based health interventions  will be more informed and therefore more effective. Please stay tuned for the  results of our analysis, which we are hoping to share through presentations and  a publication in the near future.<br />
        We  also welcome comments and discussions. How are you optimizing research  methods to capture and understand social media data to improve consumer health?</p>

<h2 id="consumers">&quot;In Concert&quot;:  Consumers, Public Health and Informatics</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 05-02-2011<br />
        <strong>Lindsey Hoggle, MS, RD, PMP</strong><br />
        Managing Partner of Health Project Partners, LLC<br />
        Chair, AMIA's Consumer Health Informatics Working Group<br />
        <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindseybh">@lindseybh</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a></p>
      <p>&quot;In Concert&quot;&mdash;familiar words that bring  associations of intricate harmonies, virtuoso performances, talented  achievement, and creative coordination. While reading the proposed <em>Draft</em> <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/health-it-strategic-planning">Federal  Health IT Strategic Plan (2011–2015)</a>, I noticed the phrase 'In Concert' was  used five times&mdash;each time with a focus on consumers, information and learning:</p>
      <p>&quot;Policies and regulations … will work <strong>in  concert with meaningful use</strong> to facilitate improved <strong><em>individual</em></strong> access  to data.&quot;<br />
        &quot;Incentive Programs will work <strong>in  concert</strong> to promote the integration of <strong><em>consumer</em> technologies </strong>into  clinical workflows to improve physical and behavioral health and care.&quot;<br />
        &quot;Certain <strong><em>consumer</em></strong> health  IT applications, when used <strong>by <em>consumers</em> and providers  in concert</strong>, enable improvement in these domains.&quot;<br />
        &quot;There are two areas where the government  is working <strong>in concert with the framework of meaningful use</strong> and  the Affordable Care Act to prepare for a future that is hard to predict: 1)  enabling health IT innovation and research, and 2) leading the creation of  a <strong><em>learning health system</em></strong>.&quot;<br />
        &quot;…will work<strong> in concert with the  Affordable Care Act</strong> to create demand for<strong><em> health care  information</em></strong> throughout the health care system.&quot;</p>
      <p>        Leveraging the infinite information of the web,  I discovered that the <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/in+concert">Free  Dictionary </a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> defines the phrase &quot;In Concert&quot; as <strong><em>&quot;with  a common plan&quot;.</em></strong> Perfect. The spotlight is now shining on the  health care consumer (or patient or individual&mdash;terms that I use interchangeably  here). Consumer Health Informatics, innovative technologies, and the patient  are taking center stage. Health care has finally acknowledged that the health  care system <em>needs</em> the patient in order to become more  efficient, more cost-effective, more streamlined and more relevant! Patients  who are aware of the power of health information and technologies understand  that they can own their health care history, influence the accuracy of their  health care record (the electronic one!) and can work in concert with their  health care providers to make informed decisions about their own health care.</p>
      <p>        The momentum driving health care change has  escalated to an &quot;all musicians on stage&quot; mode. Consensus that change  is needed is consistent&mdash;our present health care system is not sustainable.  Health care consumes <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/index.html">17.6   percent (2009) </a>of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Gross Domestic Product  (GDP).</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> In economic terms, the continued growth rate will wreak havoc  on an already struggling economy.<br />
        See the connection? Building relationships  between consumers, health care providers and government agencies that help them  work <em>in concert</em> together will provide a new paradigm for  health care, which has the potential to improve care and efficiencies&mdash;in a  mutually sustainable way.</p>
      <p>        The <em>Draft</em> Federal Health IT  Strategic Plan connects the dots between consumer and public health  informatics, emphasizing their interdependencies:</p>
      <p><em>Health IT facilitates coordination across public  health entities and other organizations, improves identification of at-risk  populations and their adherence to public health guidelines, expedites  responses to threats, notifiable conditions, and adverse population events, and  promotes consumer participation in public health by encouraging healthy  behaviors and behaviors that screen for, detect, and effectively manage  disease.</em> </p>
      <p>        Still following? If so, please join me to take  action that will catapult informatics and consumer and public health in the  right direction. A <a href="http://phi2011.amia.org/tracks">consensus  meeting</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> designed to set the next informatics agenda in public health  for the next decade is taking place May 25–27, 2011, in Orlando, Florida. It is  being convened by <a href="https://www.amia.org/">AMIA</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> the professional  association for informatics professionals, and promises to take the best and  brightest recommendations from those in public health agencies&mdash;including those  responsible for community, state, and federal initiatives in public health and  consumer health&mdash;to the next level. The outcomes of this national meeting will  be published as a white paper in <a href="http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/"><em>JAMIA</em></a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>  AMIA's research journal that reports what's happening in informatics in  biomedicine and health.</p>
      <p>        During the past two years, an intense,  unprecedented discussion on the main points of health care has occurred&mdash;so we  can gain access to and use the right data, at the right time, under the right  conditions. The Health Information Technology for Economic &amp; Clinical  Health Act (<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/health-it-legislation">HITECH</a>),  passed in February 2009, has a deliberate plan to bring the best and brightest  minds together for creation of &quot;A  Learning Health System.&quot; This new approach will mean that health data  &quot;will be available to support decisions critical to the patient and also  the community, such as prediction of a national pandemic, or research for new  treatment and conditions.&quot; The <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/">Institute  of Medicine</a> has published a <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11903">workshop summary</a> on  the concept. During the development of <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/how-attain-meaningful-use">&quot;Meaningful  Use&quot;</a> under HITECH, almost every aspect of health care has been  touched upon&mdash;in short we need a health system that has appropriate access to  information so that individuals' and population health will improve.</p>
      <p>        Are we &quot;in concert&quot; yet? Doesn't quite  sound like it: Concerts typically embody a blend of harmony, cooperation,  coordination, attention to detail and a pleasing result. Great shows require  the work of many experts skilled in the delivery of specific skills. Prior to  the performance, the stage is cluttered with equipment packaging, untethered  electrical cords and instruments which when assembled create the look, touch,  sound desired. It rarely comes together perfectly hours before the performance  and obviously is not appropriate to be assembled after the concert begins. In  terms of health care we are at the &quot;discordant&quot; phase. The performers  (providers) are on notice, sheet music (technology) is identified, but not in  everyone's hands and program (standards, certification) is in the development,  but not yet available in hard copy. Most importantly, the conductor has not  even called rehearsals yet. No, we're not in concert yet.<br />
        Individual behaviors, and the ways in which  communities foster healthy behaviors, are powerful forces for improving  population health. If you've made it this far in the conversation I've started,  you are likely one of many visionaries needed for long-range planning. If so, I  hope you'll join me and <a href="http://phi2011.amia.org/people">key  leaders</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> in the informatics community who also think these issues are  critical to our country's future direction in health care.

<h2 id="where">Where Does Informatics Fit In: A  Transdisciplinary Approach</h2>

        Office of the Director, Division of Cancer Control and Population Science<br />
        National Cancer Institute</p>
      <p>        I recently had the pleasure of attending a  meeting where I heard about systems-oriented approaches to cancer research,  the <a href="https://aspo.org/">American Society of Preventive Oncology  Meeting</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> (ASPO) 2011 Annual Meeting. A systems-approach is based on the  concept of the human body being composed of &ldquo;interdependent elements  interacting to achieve a common aim.&rdquo;  The most important common aim is to  continue living, of course, but other smaller systems are responsible for  keeping our bodies appropriately supplied with oxygen with carbon dioxide  removed – this is the cardiopulmonary system. The presentations covered areas  like tobacco, obesity, diet, environmental exposures and how team science  approaches to transdisciplinary research could be used to investigate the many  dimensions of cancer prevention.  At the National Cancer Institute, I have  had the honor to work with a diverse group of researchers on a range of  biomedical informatics projects across the cancer care continuum in a  collaborative atmosphere.  I noticed this same atmosphere of  &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; at ASPO&rsquo;s annual meeting, and as an informatician, I began to  wonder about what kind of informatics infrastructure we need to support these  transdisciplinary approaches to cancer research.</p>
      <p>        There is a prevalence and preponderance of  simple, linear models of health that we all use in our everyday lives. For some  types of unwellness this is appropriate and useful. If we have a cold, we take  more vitamin C, we rest, we drink more fluids and so on. We can do just one or  do all of these things but we don't expect the effect of more rest to somehow  multiply the effects of more fluids, just that doing both is better than just  one. However for many other kinds of health challenges the reality is messier.<br />
        Messier because we are all different due to our  genetic inheritance, habits of smoking, diet and exercise and family health  history. More interesting, because there is research into all of these factors  and their interactions that is starting to tease out the basis for choosing the  kinds of therapies that are appropriate for you.</p>
      <p>        A good example is the challenge of helping  someone to quit smoking. You may know someone who, after smoking for ten or  twenty years, was able to just decide to stop &ldquo;cold turkey&rdquo;; not that it was  without difficulty but there seemed to be no agony involved in the process. You  also no doubt know others who quit smoking and relapsed several times and some  who just gave up after a while. A simple model of this would be that it is  merely a matter of who has the most will power, but this oversimplifies the  issues involved. The research is showing that the reasons for differences in  the ability to stop smoking are linked to our genetic predisposition and to the  ways that nicotine can hijack our brains.</p>
      <p>        At the ASPO meeting, Dr. Peter Shields from  Georgetown University presented a review of studies entitled, &ldquo;Where Do We  Stand on Genetic Predictors of Smoking Behaviors?&rdquo;, representing a number of  different research domains: neuroscience, genetics, GWAS, pharmacogenetics and  behavioral medicine. Using a transdisciplinary approach can be challenging  since the language and concepts of each domain are so different, but Dr.  Shields was able to show how the evidence from one domain could be linked with  that from another, eventually connecting a person&rsquo;s inherited genetic code to  the drug that is best in helping that person to stop smoking.<br />
        Briefly, the nicotine molecule is able to breeze  through the blood-brain barrier and act as a neurotransmitter in the  opioid/dopamine circuitry. In this way, nicotine acts similarly to other drugs  such as cocaine and heroin. The nicotine actually can reprogram the  neurally-based response of smokers – although not all smokers – to visual  stimuli related to smoking, something that can be detected looking at something  called ERPs (Event Related brain Potentials) using high-density EEG. This  reprogramming has the effect of making it much harder for a person to stop  smoking. Since not everyone has the same difficulty quitting and not everyone  responds the same to different drugs to help quit, the question arises is it  possible to personalize the therapy using our genetic profile? Could a  relatively simple EEG test be used to indirectly identify that genetic profile?</p>
      <p>        Dr. Shields showed that research has  demonstrated a relationship between our genes and our ability to quit smoking  with the assistance of two different drugs, buproprion and varenicline; some of  us do better with one or the other and our genetic profile helps to decide  which one to choose. Now that is personalized medicine!</p>
      <p>        After I left this presentation I reflected on  how there are two challenges to informatics implicit in this research. The  first is the ability to aggregate and integrate data from many different  domains and levels – genetic to behavioral – and across heterogeneous data  sources with varying terminologies and taxonomies. The second is a result of  the cross- and transdisciplinary nature of this work; it requires individuals  who are willing to engage in collaboration and teamwork. An informatics  infrastructure that can support transdisciplinary research is emerging from  efforts made in Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL and ontologies). This  framework enables the meaningful connections of disparate data sources with the  use of ontologies; it can then provide different researchers with a view of the  underlying data that is meaningful to them. This concept can then be used to  access the same data in order to support evidence-based communication of  information that is meaningful to consumers.</p>
      <p>        Many public and private organizations have moved  towards more consumer-focused, personalized medicine.  However, what  happens if we don&rsquo;t have the proper infrastructure in place to support this?  And, can we get there faster if that infrastructure supports team science  approaches to transdisciplinary research?</p>

<h2 id="patient">Patient-facing Health IT:  Bridging or Widening the Digital Divide?</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 06-21-2011<br />
        <strong>Urmimala Sarkar, MD, M.P.H.</strong><br />
        Assistant Professor<br />
        University of California San Francisco<br />
        San Francisco General Hospital Center for Vulnerable Populations</p>
      <p> With all the recent discussion of internet use,  health information technology (HIT) and health care, it&rsquo;s important to talk  about who might be getting left behind. With the HIT revolution, the digital  divide is becoming an increasingly important consideration for health care. As  a primary care provider in a safety-net health system, I worry that my  patients, who are low-income and often uninsured, may not benefit from the  widespread implementation of patient-facing health information technology  because they lack access or ability to use the internet.</p>
      <p>This concern led my collaborators and me to examine use of a leading patient  portal, Kaiser Permanente&rsquo;s state-of-the-art secure portal (<a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/">https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>).  We looked at more than 14,000 English-speaking adults with diabetes who are  part of the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) -- making it the  largest observational study to assess use of a patient portal among diabetes  patients in the United States (available online at Journal of the American  Medical Informatics Association<a href="http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/">http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> and  Journal of Health Communication <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10810730.2010.499988">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10810730.2010.499988</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>).  We chose patients with diabetes because we know they have significant health  needs and expected them to make use of a patient portal.</p>
      <p>Internet-based patient portals allow patients to access their health  information, including their diagnostic test results, to perform health-related  tasks such as making medical appointments and requesting refills of  prescription medications, and to interact with providers through secure email  messages. Such patient portals are considered a core component of &ldquo;meaningful  use&rdquo; of health information technology under federal health reform legislation,  and will be rapidly implemented across U.S. health care settings in the coming  years. If low-income populations, ethnic minority groups, and those with  limited educational attainment and health literacy have less access to or  familiarity with this technology, there is good reason to worry that they will  fall further behind in terms of their health. This fits with the &ldquo;inverse care  law,&rdquo; the observation that health innovations can actually widen health  disparities as they disproportionately benefit advantaged segments of the  population.</p>
      <p>In our study, we found that people with limited education, in certain racial/  ethnic minority groups (African-American and Latino/a), and those with limited  health literacy, are less likely to sign up to use an internet- based patient  portal.  Even among those that did sign up <em>via the internet</em> for  the patient portal, Latino/a populations and African Americans, as well as  those with limited health literacy, were less likely to actually use it. This  is particularly worrisome because the patients less likely to use the patient  portal are those who are already known to have worse diabetes outcomes.</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that a digital divide exists on multiple distinct levels.  First, there is a well-known lack of access to computers and the internet among  low-income and ethnic minority populations. Lack of access and interest likely  explains our finding of less people signing up to use the patient portal.  Overcoming this obstacle by strengthening internet connectivity and computer  access across all U.S. communities is critical to addressing the digital divide  in health. Specific outreach targeted to these groups about patient portal  availability and use may also bridge this gap. Beyond access, however, is the  issue of <em>navigation </em>of patient-directed health information  technology. I suspect that some people who signed up for the patient portal,  but did not use it, had difficulty using the actual patient portal site.  However, I would not be surprised if many people who have difficulty  successfully using an internet-based patient portal are able to use the  internet for other purposes. Building in features such as access in multiple  languages, layout and language appropriate for those with limited health  literacy, and smart design to help with navigation, should be fundamental to  all patient-facing health information technology, not an afterthought.</p>
      <p> The internet has tremendous potential to use video, images, and multilingual  techniques, with wide population reach. This could greatly enhance  comprehensibility of health care and health promotion. Patient portals  additionally can expand access to core health activities such as managing  prescription medications and communicating with health care providers. If we  want to realize this potential to improve public health, we need to not only  increase <em>access</em>, but also improve usability and lower the literacy  demands of patient-facing HIT. It&rsquo;s time to move beyond the inverse care law  and bring all populations into the digital age for health.</p>

<h2 id="scienceofteam">The &lsquo;Science of Team  Science&rsquo;: Best Practices for Team-Based Collaboration</h2>
      <p>Posted on 06-23-2011<br />
        <strong>Amanda  L. Vogel, Ph.D., MHS and Kara L. Hall, Ph.D.</strong></p>
      <p>        If  you are working on projects to enhance behavioral support for healthcare  consumers, you may be collaborating with a diverse set of partners such as physicians,  applied health professionals, health administrators, informatics and technology  experts, patients and their families, and other stakeholders.</p>
      <p>        Collaborations  that cast a wide net in terms of their membership may benefit greatly from the  variety of perspectives, skills, and expertise that team members bring to bear.  For example they can create innovations by applying or combining approaches  from a wide variety of disciplines, professions, or fields. In fact teams with  diverse membership are increasingly encouraged and supported, as a means of  stimulating innovation and creativity.</p>
      <p>        But  collaborations with diverse members must also address some unique challenges  that are introduced by this approach, if they wish to maximize their  effectiveness. For example once you compose a team of diverse members, it is  important to engage in a deliberate group process to develop joint goals that  are also relevant to each team member, shared understandings and expectations  of the work process, and a shared vocabulary for discussing work processes and  goals. Another challenge that needs to be addressed in order to allow members  to contribute effectively and fully is how best to coordinate and integrate  members&rsquo; activities given their unique areas of expertise, goals for the  collaboration, and competing priorities.</p>
      <p>        Team-based  collaborations that take place across geographic distances and institutions are  increasingly common. These collaborations introduce unique benefits, foremost  the ability to engage partners with specific expertise wherever they are  located in the world. But they also introduce additional challenges, including  how best to work with collaborators from institutions with very different  organizational cultures, how to work effectively across time zones, or how to  develop mutual understanding with collaborations from different cultural  backgrounds who may have different communication styles and expectations for  collaborations.</p>
      <p>        Luckily  there is an entire field of scholarship and practice that is dedicated to identifying  the best ways to address these challenges, and maximize the efficiency and  effectiveness of collaborative science initiatives.</p>
      <h3>The  &ldquo;Science of Team Science&rdquo; Field</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Science  of Team Science (SciTS)</strong> field  is a new and rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that is generating  practical knowledge about how to maximize the effectiveness of team-based  collaborations, as applied, specifically, to the conduct of research.</p>
      <p>        The  SciTS field was created in response to the growing prevalence of cross-disciplinary  and cross-field collaborative research initiatives that aim to address complex  and multi-causal real-world problems, such as climate change and the growing  prevalence of chronic disease.</p>
      <p>        SciTS  scholars study the antecedent conditions and collaboration processes that  influence the effectiveness of team science. The immediate aim of the field is  to produce transferrable lessons about how to address challenges, maximize  benefits, and ultimately improve the effectiveness of team-based science. The  ultimate goal of the field is to enhance the scientific outcomes of  collaborative, team-based research, including productivity and innovation.</p>
      <p>        The  SciTS field is producing helpful practices for efficient and effective  collaboration, which have applications to collaborations to develop and  implement behavioral interventions. There are also many leaders in the U.S. and  abroad who are creating platforms to disseminate best practices for  collaborative team-based science. Two of these resources are the Team Science Toolkit,  and the Annual International Science of Team Science Conference. The rest of  this blog provides an introduction to these resources, including links where  you go to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="potential">The Potential of Multilevel  Interventions to Improve Health IT</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 07-11-2011<br />

        National Cancer Institute</p>
      <p>        The statistics on the U.S. health care system are  often cited and lamented. From the floors of Congress to offices of local  health clinics, the concerns over the health care system&rsquo;s staggering costs and  relatively poor return on investment compared to other countries command  attention and prompt discussions about potential solutions.</p>
      <p>A long held view of health behavior and health care delivery is that both are  influenced by multiple levels of the environmental context. For example, people  seeking care are affected by the care provider team who in turn are affected by  the organization where they practice and the community wherein that  organization operates, and all are affected by national health policy. Recently  at national conference on Multilevel Interventions in Health Care, Stephen  Taplin, MD, M.P.H., of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) explained that the past  approach of focusing on one level hasn&rsquo;t corrected the problems in health care  delivery in the US, possibly because such approaches have not sufficiently  considered the larger context in which care is delivered. Thus the Multilevel  Interventions (MLI) project was created to foster ideas about improving care  through interventions that target multiple levels and take into consideration  how each level affects the others.</p>
      <p>        The NCI hosted the conference in March, 2011, in Las Vegas, to talk about this  concept. Approximately 170 health professionals and researchers attended the  conference and participated in discussions about how to improve health care by  considering the complex, multilayered environment in which that care is  delivered. Forming the foundation for discussion were 13 presentations covering  the challenges and opportunities of multilevel research and application,  keynote addresses by Drs. Richard Scott and Otis Brawley, and discussion  sessions with conference participants. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL0126837269E084C5">Videos of these  sessions</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> are posted on the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s YouTube  channel. The papers presented at the conference will be published in an  upcoming supplement to the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>.</p>
      <p>        Informatics play an important role in multilevel interventions, both in terms  of data tools for identifying targets or predicting effects of interventions  (such as aggregated electronic health records data and intervention simulation  applications) and health care improvement tools (such as decision support, care  coordination programs, and health management apps). The process of implementing  some health IT tools in health care delivery settings in order to achieve  meaningful outcomes may require a multilevel approach.</p>
      <p>        For example, an electronic health records (EHR) system&rsquo;s installation and effective  use within a defined clinical setting will require support and buy-in at the  organizational level (administrators) and the provider team level but also  needs policy level support to facilitate adoption, as the HITECH Act proposes  to do. In fact, adoption of electronic medical records has been slow until this  point nationally. One might argue that the lack of alignment of all three  levels has slowed implementation and that national policy that provides support  and incentive is a critical third factor that must be aligned. The alternate  scenarios are that a) without the financial or regulatory enticements to invest  in EHR systems that are provided by policy, the costs of such investments would  be prohibitive for many health care practices, b) without authorization from  the administration, staff time and training for learning and using the system  would be unsupported, and c) without provider team support/perceived utility  for the records, one might predict a lack of utilization or incomplete  utilization of the system. Should an intervention to increase and improve EHR  use target only one level, resistance at another level could cause the EHRs to  fail to reach their maximum benefit to patients and the health care system as a  whole.</p>
      <p>        Clearly a simplification of the factors that contribute to EHR adoption, this  scenario still illustrates the need for a multilevel approach to addressing  health care delivery problems. Such an approach recognizes that although each  level&rsquo;s role may be distinctly defined, each interacts with and influences the  other levels. Interventions that target multiple levels simultaneously will  take into consideration the context of the other players in the decision and  use of EHRs. While multilevel interventions in health IT have the potential to  be as complicated as the problems they attempt to solve, the NCI multilevel  team hopes the upcoming supplement to the<em> Journal of the National  Cancer Institute</em> will provide useful guidance in the areas of design,  measurement, and application of multilevel intervention research.</p>

<h2 id="improving">Improving Consumer Health  IT Application Development: Lessons from Other Industries</h2>

      <p>        The  Institute of Medicine's (IOM), <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10027/chapter/1"><em>Crossing the Quality Chasm</em></a> (2001) report lists the delivery of  patient-centered care &quot;that is respectful of and responsive to individual  patient preferences, needs, and values&quot; as one of the six critical  components for transforming health care delivery. To realize this vision of a  patient-centered health care system where &quot;patient values guide all  clinical decisions&quot; (p. 40) we need information technologies and tools in  place for consumers to store, retrieve, track, and share their health-related  information and behaviors with their health care providers. Despite the best  efforts of vocal industry advocates, consumers' adoption and use of those  health information technologies and tools remains low. We believe enabling  effective consumer adoption and use begins with successful product design.</p>
      <p>        Here  at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), we are working to  ensure the effective design of consumer health information technology (IT)  applications that improve health care quality through efforts such as our July  27–28, 2009 workshop, &quot;<a href="https://healthit.ahrq.gov/ahrq-funded-projects/personal-health-information-management-and-design-consumer-health-it/building-bridges-consumer-needs-and-design-health-information-technology">Building  Bridges: Consumer Needs and the Design of Health IT</a>&quot;. One of the  outgrowths of this successful workshop is our recently released report <a href="https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/citation/background_report_final.pdf"><em>Improving Consumer Health IT  Application Development: Lessons From Other Industries, Background Report</em></a> (PDF).  The report, authored by staff at the University of Maryland's Center for Health  Information and Decision Systems at the Robert H. Smith School of Business  (under a subcontract with Westat, Inc.), aptly summarizes and synthesizes the  design methods used to develop successful consumer products in various  non-health care related industries.</p>
      <h3>REVIEW  OF COMMONLY USED DESIGN METHODS AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS</h3>
      <p>The  authors began by using Google&trade; and  Google Scholar&trade; to  conduct broad searches with keywords such as product development, consumer  products, user-centered design, and product usability. They identified 18  distinct development methods which they characterized along seven dimensions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Structure  (low to high)</li>
        <li>Iteration  (low to high)</li>
        <li>Span of  approach (single stage to entire development cycle)</li>
        <li>User  involvement (low to high)</li>
        <li>Design  team composition (narrow to broad)</li>
        <li>Novelty  of product (low to high)</li>
        <li>Virtualizability  (low to high)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next,  the authors created a roadmap for understanding the design methods used in  these non-health care related consumer products by selecting 24 popular  products and classifying them as either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communication  (including social networking)</li>
        <li>e-Commerce</li>
        <li>Information  storage, archival, and retrieval;</li>
        <li>Personalized  entertainment;</li>
        <li>Gaming;</li>
        <li>Learning  applications; or</li>
        <li>Smart  phone products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The  project team and subject matter experts determined consumer product popularity  by estimating successful diffusion in recent years based on number of users and  sales. Finally, several successful products from each of the product categories  were identified and reviewed.</p>
      <p>        For  each successful product, the team reviewed the category, name, type (purely  digital product that may operate on a variety of platforms, or hybrid product  incorporating an integrated physical device with a digital component as a  single product), description, user characteristics, and design method(s) used.  For each successful consumer product, the authors determined the design  method(s) used and then identified the common design method themes across  products. Again, they conducted Internet searches on Google&reg; and Google  Scholar&trade; using the product name in combination with keywords related to design  (e.g., design, development, and user profile).</p>
      <h3>THE  DESIGN METHODS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS</h3>
      <p>The  top six most frequently used design methods were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prototyping</li>
        <li>Agile  development</li>
        <li>Heuristic  evaluation</li>
        <li>Top-down  design</li>
        <li>Lean  product development</li>
        <li>Goals,  Operations, Methods, and Selection Rules (GOMS)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The  design teams' frequent use of these particular methods suggests that a focus on  user experience with development methodologies incorporating iteration is  increasing to respond to rapid changes in the market environment. In fact, the  majority of the successful consumer products analyzed were developed using  design methods with high levels of both user involvement and iteration.  Additionally, organizations creating highly successful consumer products  consistently use design methods that include high levels of iteration. This  underscores that good design is an evolutionary process and that products  themselves will be continually changing to respond to changing consumer  preferences. The importance of prototyping in the iteration process is  supported in the literature. Enabling consumers to use the product and provide  feedback into the design process, rather than simply conducting interviews or  focus groups, aids the determination of the functionality that users value in a  product or service.</p>
      <p>        Also  of note is that for the top three design methods used, the design team size and  skill sets of all three were characterized as having medium breadth. This  suggests that very large or highly diverse teams may detract from team  effectiveness because of difficulties in communication and coordination.</p>
      <p>        In  addition, many successful consumer products listed in the report were developed  using more than one design method. However, hybrid products utilize multiple  methods averaging almost 65 percent more design methods than purely digital  products. By number, hybrid products use 4.4 methods compared to 2.6 methods for  purely digital products. The overall average of design methods used for all  products is 3.2.</p>
      <p>        The  report also suggests that developers of successful consumer products approach  design with an attention to the number of features incorporated into their products.  This was evidenced through the review of the products studied, which were found  to be streamlined and simple, at least at the user interface level, and not  overloaded with features that overwhelm the user.</p>
      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
      <p>To  conclude, the findings for all 24 successful consumer products and their  respective design methods are summarized below.<br />
        For  all consumer products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High levels of user involvement       and iteration were used.</li>
        <li>Product design teams usually       utilized one or more of the following design methods: prototyping; agile       development; heuristic evaluation; top-down design; lean product       development; and GOMS.</li>
        <li>Design teams typically had       medium breadth in regard to team size and the skill sets represented.</li>
        <li>Human factors experts were often       engaged in the design team.</li>
        <li>Designers selected a spare set       of features in the application to &quot;keep it simple.&quot; Careful       attention was paid to user characteristics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For  hybrid consumer products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple design       methods were typically used.</li>
        <li>Designers       generally used prototypes and consumer feedback based on their use of the       prototype.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our  next activity for this project is to interview designers of successful consumer  products. Their responses will contribute to a foundation of recommendations  intended to guide the development of consumer health IT applications. This  effort is one part of AHRQ's interest in better understanding and supporting  individuals' personal health information management practices through the use  of consumer health IT.</p>
      <p>        As  part of this program of work, the AHRQ Health IT Portfolio published a related  funding opportunity announcement, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-11-199.html"><strong>Understanding User Needs and Context to Inform  Consumer Health Information Technology (IT) Design (R01)</strong></a>. This  new opportunity will fund projects supporting the development of a knowledge  base about consumers' personal health information management needs and  practices and related design principles. This opportunity is aligned with  AHRQ's overarching interest in sponsoring research leading to a robust  understanding of user needs and context which will impact consumer health IT  design.</p>

<h2 id="making">Making Health IT a Team  Sport</h2>
      <p>Posted on 10-07-2011<br />
        <strong>Lindsey Hoggle</strong><br />
        Managing Partner of Health Project Partners, LLC<br />
        Chair, AMIA's Consumer Health Informatics Working Group</p>
      <p>        On  September 12, 2011, the Office of the National Coordinator of Health  Information Technology, (ONC) released the Final <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/health-it-strategic-planning">Federal  Health IT Strategic Plan (2011–2015)</a> in  response to feedback received on the draft version during the public comment  period from March–May 2011. While this call for comments may not have attracted  as much attention as other topics up for comment, this Plan is critical to the  overall success of the HITECH Act's <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/">Electronic Health Record  Incentive Program</a>. As a nation, we need to &quot;begin with the end in  mind,&quot; so the draft Plan was the foundation for my previous <a href="#consumers">ICH  blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>        It  is important to appreciate that the Plan is a living document, informed by the  240 responses to the call for comments. It will be updated based on  experiences, lessons learned, and the collaborative assimilation of strategy  from a team from varied backgrounds. ONC's <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/">HealthIT Buzz Blog</a> provided an overview of the main  changes made to the Plan. There are five key topics which took on a stronger  focus in the final version:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Barriers  to adoption and health information exchange.</strong> What is standing in the way of our use of health IT?</li>
        <li><strong>Standards  harmonization.</strong> In order  to exchange digital health data, computers&mdash;and people&mdash;need to be able to speak  the same language.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination  of care</strong>&mdash;or perhaps that is my interpretation of &quot;support for the  inclusion of providers not eligible for incentive payments under the Medicare  and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs in information exchange for purposes of  care coordination.&quot;</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility.</strong> Regardless of situations or disparities, we need to make health  care&mdash;and good health&mdash;available to all.</li>
        <li><strong>Team  health care.</strong> There is  concern that the private sector&mdash;and other non-physician providers&mdash;are not  engaged in learning about efforts [to improve the health care system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Almost  at the same time of the Final Plan release, President Obama declared September  11–17, 2011 <a href="http://www.healthitweek.org/">National Health IT Week.</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> It served as a transition week, where  many events marked renewed commitment and, most importantly, a conviction that  we can and will improve health care. In my mind, it was no coincidence that  this transitional event coincided with the onset of the fall season, shifting  from sweltering summer days to the crisp touch of autumn. Washington, D.C. is  an area fortunate to have equal access to all the seasons; just as one grows  weary of the heat of summer, the mornings suddenly become chilly&mdash;almost  cold&mdash;and the leaves seem to fade overnight to brilliant fall hues. Around the  same time, the nation turns to an infectious preoccupation with football. Be it  college, the National Football League (NFL), or even the local high school,  there is a nonstop attention to the details of the sport&mdash;well, at least for  some of us! In my mind, the launch of football season and adoption of health IT  have some very convenient similarities.</p>
      <h3>The  Culture of Safety Must Be Pervasive</h3>
      <p>As  with any sport, the safety of its players and fans is first and foremost. This  year, the NFL added a layer of safety rules to the sport, causing grumbling  among some fans. The point is&mdash;the NFL leaders are in constant motion on  evaluating potential or existing risks to players. This &quot;culture of  safety&quot; has to be a cornerstone to health IT adoption. Beginning with the  Institute of Medicine report <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx"><em>To Err is Human: Building a Safer  Health System</em></a>, the &quot;safety&quot; practices of health care  across the country have come under the magnifying glass. It is not a pretty  picture. A focus on quality and best practices for safety is now woven into  almost every discussion on health care. And, most importantly, it is recognized  as everybody's problem. Many initiatives have evolved from this discussion; the  new <a href="http://www.qualityforum.org/setting_priorities/npp/national_priorities_partnership.aspx">National Priorities  Partnership</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> for example, is a multi-stakeholder collaborative which serves  to keep the focus on the right priorities and create a culture of safety and  quality care practices.</p>
      <h3>Failed  Handoffs Can Be a Show-Stopper</h3>
      <p>You  don't have to be a football fan to appreciate the fact that any glitch in  handing off the ball brings progress to a standstill. It can happen in a  multitude of ways&mdash;be it a handoff from the quarterback, a short pass, or a  &quot;Hail Mary.&quot; There has to be a well-executed plan, including clear  communication, split-second timing, and attention to detail. These details also  pertain to health care. Not only do we have a fragmented system where personal  health information is spread over a variety of different providers, but we have  historically failed at the handoffs or transitions of care&mdash;so much so, that ONC  this year established the <a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/Transitions+of+Care+%28ToC%29+Initiative">Transitions  of Care Initiative</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> within its <a href="http://wiki.siframework.org">Standards  and Interoperability Framework</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> This initiative serves to establish  critical characteristics and data that are vital for a patient to be  transferred successfully from one facility to another, to the home, or to caregivers.  Just as in football, botching a handoff can have permanent, undesirable  consequences.</p>
      <h3>Teamwork  Is Key</h3>
      <p>This  is my favorite area, yet one that needs considerably more focus. Football could  not exist without the team concept. Take away a key player and the quality  deteriorates. Communication is critical; everyone has a specific role and there  has to be a coach. The defensive team has to work artfully with the offensive  team or the results are dismal. Health care is no different. While the  defense/offense mechanism appears to reflect conflicting processes within the  game structure, it does not. The focus and intended outcome is the same&mdash;to win  the game. Health care also has what appears to be opposing roles&mdash;providers,  insurance plans, hospitals. Their goals, however are the same&mdash;to take the best  possible care of the patient. There needs to be a &quot;coach,&quot; or  provider, who knows and utilizes the best available care for the patient&mdash;thus,  the medical home model. All the team members have to understand their role,  feel respected as a contributor, and work diligently to bring their best to the  table. Payment mechanisms need to be in place. <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/">The  patient has to be on the team.</a> We  are moving away from a culture of patients on the sidelines or in the stands,  watching as the game is played. Patients have to be active team players for our  health system to improve.</p>
      <h3>Change  Is Certain</h3>
      <p>The  past few years have been difficult not only because of the challenging economic  conditions, but the realization that our health system is neither affordable  nor very effective. Just as football teams change their strategies to field a  winning team, adapt to the rules necessary to protect their players, and show  football fans what they want to see, health care best practices have to evolve  as evidence-based care and the team needs to work collaboratively to implement  sound practices and treatments. Now is the time for the team huddle to improve  health care through the use of health IT&mdash;and to understand what changes <strong>must</strong> take place. Perhaps this is the  critical difference between football and health care: there is no reason we  cannot<strong> </strong><strong>all</strong> be winners.</p>
      <div style="text-align:right;"><a href="#">Back to Top</a></div>
<h2 id="research">Can We Close the  Research-to-Practice Gap in Health Care?</h2>
      <p>Posted on 11-03-2011<br />
        <strong>Janey Sturtz McMillen, Ph.D.</strong><br />
        Research Director<br />
        3-C Institute for Social Development</p>
      <p>        The  National Institutes of Health (NIH) invests over $31.2 billion annually in  medical research (NIH, 2011) much of it devoted to treatment studies which are  vitally important. Unfortunately, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2001) reports  it takes an average of 17 years for clinical research findings to be used  regularly in clinical practice (p. 13). How do we &quot;close the gap&quot;&mdash;as  numerous Federal reports have called us to do&mdash;to move effective interventions  and practices from the strict conditions of the &quot;bench&quot; to the  reality of the &quot;bedside&quot;?</p>
      <p>        At  first glance, closing the gap may seem to simply be an issue of providing  clinicians with adequate information about proven practices and their  effectiveness. Given the choice between a treatment that is proven to work and  one that is not, won't the overwhelming majority of clinicians choose the  proven treatment? However, much information has been provided and yet the gap  still exists. Clearly, to understand <strong>how</strong> to close the gap, we must understand <strong>why</strong> there is a gap in the first place.</p>
      <p>        I  recently attended the <a href="https://globalimplementation.org/">Global Implementation  Conference</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> in Washington, DC,  to get some answers. What I heard is that no matter how effective a treatment  is during testing, if it is not delivered with high quality and sustainability  outside of the research lab, it will not be effective. In fact, a new and  growing body of literature examines the challenges clinicians face in using  research-tested interventions in practice. Several factors have been identified  that support adoption and high quality implementation&mdash;e.g., pre-implementation  training on core components and acceptable adaptations, as well as ongoing  implementation assistance and adherence monitoring. However, because the field  of implementation science is a relatively new one, there is still no clear  evidence on the most effective and cost-efficient way to address these factors  in health care delivery.</p>
      <p>        In  our work with intervention developers and clinicians across the country here at  the <a href="http://www.3cisd.com/">3-C Institute for Social Development</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> we have  seen an increasing interest in using information technology to improve health.  I believe many of the factors shown to foster high quality health care delivery  could be accomplished by providing ongoing implementation assistance, such as  online supervision and booster training sessions, which could increase the  sustainability of a proven practice over time. With the appropriate system  protections, health information technology (HIT) could be used to monitor  patient adherence to the treatment protocol as well as treatment outcomes.<br />
        My  Institute colleagues share my enthusiasm for this idea. We have recently received  funding from NIH to develop a flexible technology infrastructure called &quot;<a href="https://centervention.org/about-us">CenterVention</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>&quot; This  technology infrastructure has been designed to foster high quality  implementation and sustainability for research-tested interventions within  treatment settings on a broad scale. We are hopeful that this project can serve  as a testing ground for using HIT to &quot;close the gap&quot; from research to  practice. As we venture forth into this territory, we welcome your comments!</p>

<h2 id="what">What Can We Do With All That  Data?</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 01-24-2012<br />
        Federal agencies have made a wealth of data on  health and health care available in public data sets. But sifting through and  making sense of all that information can be challenging, especially for  consumers and professionals without a high level of technical expertise. <strong>Abdul  Shaikh, Ph.D., MHSc,</strong> a Program Director in the Health Communication and  Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is  making strides in getting the broader community of technology experts and  entrepreneurs to help address this challenge. His goal is to make public health  data more usable for different audiences including consumers and healthcare  professionals.</p>
      <p>        While participating in the Hawaii International  Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS) this month, Dr. Shaikh sat down with  Hawaii Public Radio to talk about the government&rsquo;s role in assisting data  users. <a href="http://hpr2.org/programs/conversation">Listen</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> to  the 10-minute interview (beginning at the 4:40 mark) to hear Dr. Shaikh's  comments on the publically available data and how the government is  funding developer challenges and supporting innovative software applications in  cancer prevention and control. </p>

<h2 id="softwareprogram">New Software Program Enhances  Analysis of Cancer Health Disparities in Population Data Sets</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 05-21-2012</p>
      <p>        For researchers and developers looking to  optimize analyses of population-based health data, the National Cancer  Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program now  offers the <strong>Health Disparities Calculator (HD*Calc)</strong>. HD*Calc is a  statistical software program that generates multiple summary measures for  evaluating and monitoring health disparities. You can use it with SEER or other  population-based health data to calculate any of eleven disparity measurements.<br />
        Originally developed to expand the range of  measures for evaluating cancer-related disparities, HD*Calc can be used with  any dataset, including the National Health Interview Survey, California Health  Interview Survey, Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, and  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. You can import  cross-sectional and trend data (e.g., cancer rates, survival, stage at  diagnosis) categorized by disparity groups (e.g., area-socioeconomic status,  race/ethnicity, geographic areas) to generate four absolute and seven relative  summary measures of health disparity. The results are displayed as tables and  charts, which you can export into other applications.<br />
        Find out more about how you can use HD*Calc on  the SEER website at <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/hdcalc/">https://seer.cancer.gov/hdcalc</a>.  The site has tutorials available, including a webinar demonstration.

      <p>A  diverse group of researchers, industry leaders, clinicians, and patient  advocates gathered in Washington, D.C. on June 7th to provide input on a  national research agenda for patient engagement using health information  technology (IT) to support patient-centered communication and care coordination  for cancer.</p>
      <p>        The  roundtable was convened by the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/about-onc">Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT</a> (ONC), the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/">National  Cancer Institute</a> (NCI) at the  National Institutes for Health (NIH), and the <a href="https://www.ehidc.org/">eHealth Initiative</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> (eHI). More than 40 participants  representing a diverse cross-section of the cancer care and IT communities  contributed to the discussion of needs and gaps in cancer communication and  care coordination, potential health IT solutions, and opportunities for  research.</p>
      <h3>Themes  to Help Inform a National Research Agenda</h3>
      <p>Over  the course of the discussion, several themes related to potential needs and  opportunities for research emerged.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The opportunity       to empower an engaged population.</strong> Cancer is a       condition for which many patients, their families, and caregivers are       highly engaged and motivated to act. How can health IT help empower       patients and other stakeholders across the cancer continuum?</li>
        <li><strong>Data       interpretation and decision support.</strong> Enabling cancer       patients to access their data is a crucial step. Beyond this, there is       also a need for tools that help patients, families, and caregivers       interpret data to support shared decision-making and collaborative       self-management.</li>
        <li><strong>Balancing the       needs of individuals and populations.</strong> The advancement       of genomic sequencing technology and collaborative research in molecular       diagnostics offers the promise of accelerating discovery of more targeted       and effective therapies. However, it is equally important to understand       unique patient needs and opportunities for leveraging health IT based on       individual and contextual factors such as age, race-ethnicity,       psychosocial factors, and socioeconomic status across the cancer continuum.</li>
        <li><strong>The influence       of culture, incentives, and regulation.</strong> Despite the       promise of health IT, sociopolitical factors, policy, and financial       disincentives have limited the dissemination and impact of existing       technologies for communication and coordination in cancer.</li>
        <li><strong>Examining the       future and the present in parallel.</strong> National       priorities for research must not only consider important questions in the       field today, but also how we hope to leverage health IT to improve       communication and coordination in cancer care in the next decade.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With  these themes as a backdrop, participants offered input to help inform national  priorities by proposing a number of potential focus areas for research,  including scenarios for assessing the use and impact of health IT; approaches  for scaling success and spurring innovation; cultural and policy barriers to  adoption; and maximizing the effectiveness of health IT in cancer care for  individuals, families, and populations. One of the primary recommendations that  arose from the discussion highlighted the need to identify existing tools,  applications, and health IT-enabled processes that are successfully promoting  cancer communication and care coordination, but would benefit from  dissemination and implementation science research to evaluate and scale up  effective solutions.</p>
      <h3>What  Comes Next</h3>
      <p>With  the critical issues and innovative ideas shared by participants, ONC, NCI, and  eHI emerged from this meeting with a wealth of input that will be used to help  inform the development of scientific priority areas for using health IT to  improve patient-centered communication and care coordination for cancer. Next  steps will include the publication of more detailed proceedings to share the  meeting findings, an ONC-led pilot project with the state of Texas, and an  environmental scan to help identify high-impact systems, applications, and  tools that are successfully using health IT to improve communication and care  coordination for cancer. The purpose of the pilot is to give patients access to  their information in a format they can download and use it in innovative ways  and to assess the impact on their experience of care.<br />
        Tell  us what you think should be part of the National Research Agenda related to  consumers' use of health IT and cancer care!<br />

<h2 id="consumer">Consumer eHealth Summit: New  Technology Puts Patients in Charge</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 08-07-2012<br />
        <strong>Kasia Galica</strong><br />
        National Cancer Institute<br />
        On July 16th the National eHealth  Collaborative (NeHC) convened the Consumer  Consortium on eHealth Engagement Summit in Washington, D.C. This  stimulating event provided an opportunity for a diverse group of stakeholders  to share successes and ideas to support their common goal of engaging consumers  and patients through health information technology. The broad cross-section of  stakeholders at the meeting representing advocacy, industry, and health  research contributed to some fascinating and timely discussions on community  engagement as well as consumer and patient-centered eHealth tools and  applications.</p>
      <p>        Right off the bat, I, a freshly minted National  Cancer Institute (NCI) Fellow and avid e-consumer trained in applied  communication science, found myself applauding along with other conference  attendees at the sneak peak of a video from the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health IT (ONC). ONC's new animated video conveys the potential  for health IT to improve the quality of care for consumers. The video launched  today on <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/video/health-it-you-giving-you-access-your-medical-records">healthit.gov</a>,  and beyond its graphic appeal and catchy tune, the clip manages to say a great  deal about the latest health-related innovations, and their use in clinical and  consumer/personal contexts. Perhaps most importantly, it also sets a vision for  the future of quality care enabled by health IT. Seeing animated  representations of frustrated, paper-logged patients transitioning to informed,  empowered participants in their own care was like watching countless years and  months of research, development, policy, and advocacy squeezed into a matter of  minutes. Watch it now for yourself!</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UMiPW831b1o?rel=0" frameborder="0" title="Updated: Health IT for You: Giving You Access to Your Medical Records When and Where They're Needed"></iframe>
      <p>        The overall tone of the meeting was optimistic  as many nodded in agreement with the statement that a great deal of progress is  being made in the development of innovative tools and technologies for consumer  ehealth. However, if the diversity of the participants alluded to one thing,  it's that there are many ways to approach the complex and dynamic issues  involved with technology-mediated health care. This was demonstrated in a panel  that shared lessons learned and best practices related to consumer engagement  at the community level.</p>
      <p>        For instance, Elizabeth McKnight with The  Alliance of Chicago explained how training health IT navigators helps patients  in 'digital deserts' get their data into electronic formats, while at the same  time enabling consumers to provide feedback on the navigation portal/user  experience. LIVESTRONG's Naveen Rao described a 'free the data' initiative  where data are available as needed by the patient. Their cancer guide and  tracker app allow patients to upload pictures and stories&mdash;even snapshots of  their paper medical record. In addition, Sarah Krug from Cancer 101  demonstrated their cancer binder designed to help patients stay organized and  informed with fact sheets and specific inserts from their physician.  Transitioning this binder to a personalized education dashboard would enable  new features such as ratings of treatment options and health care  professionals&mdash;though the option of having a paper resource would remain  available. This reminded me of the notebook and pen I keep with me at all times,  regardless of how dedicated I am to my laptop, smart phone, and tablet.</p>
      <p>        Finally, Lygeia Ricciardi described ONC's  strategic initiatives related to empowering patients and families to be  partners in their health through health IT. She outlined three key elements of  the approach (the &quot;3 As&quot;): 1. Giving consumers easy electronic <strong><em>Access</em></strong> to  their health informtion, 2.) Supporting consumers in taking <strong><em>Action</em></strong> with  their information through a variety of apps and tools, and 3.) Encouraging an  evolution in <strong><em>Attitudes</em></strong> concerning the roles of both  patients and providers. She encouraged members of the NeHC Consumer Consortium  to give input on ONC's public materials under development for healthit.gov.</p>
      <p>        In the closing remarks, Consortium Co-Chair  ePatient Dave DeBronkart reminded us that we too are not just researchers,  advocates, industry, and policy makers, but also consumers, patients, and  caregivers. He even challenged us to check out our own medical records for  errors.   When reviewing his wife's medical record, Dave noticed that her penicillin  allergy was missing, something that could easily have caused dire consequences.</p>
      <p>        Digital deserts, human error, cultural  differences, diversity of health problems, generational gaps, literacy and  language barriers&mdash;all speak strongly to the need to focus consumer engagement  with health IT on customization, needs assessment, and persistent surveillance  of consumer involvement and environment. Perhaps most importantly, research and  evaluation to help develop and implement evidence-based tools and technologies  for patient-centered care can ensure that we're getting it right.</p>

<h2 id="bluebutton">Do You Blue Button? 2012 Consumer  Health IT Summit Expands Access to Health Information</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 09-28-2012<br />
        <strong>Kasia Galica</strong><br />
        National Cancer Institute</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.va.gov/bluebutton/">Blue  Button</a> [bloo] [buht-n] <em>noun:</em> A technology that allows  users to access and download their information from their My Health<strong><em>e</em></strong>Vet  personal health record as a simple text file or PDF to be read, printed, or  saved on any computer; and shared with trusted friends or family, caregivers,  and health care providers.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.va.gov/bluebutton/">Blue  Button</a> [bloo] [buht-n] <em>verb:</em> To gain easier access to  one&rsquo;s own health data.</p>
      <p>        This August, the one millionth patient used  the <strong>Blue Button</strong> to download their data, and Todd Park (U.S.  Chief Technology Officer), Peter Levin (Chief Technology Officer, Department of  Veterans Affairs), and Farzad Mostashari (National Coordinator for Health IT,  HHS) have every reason to proclaim and celebrate the transition of the <em>noun</em> to  the <em>verb.</em></p>
      <p>        Kick starting National Health Information  Technology (HIT) Week, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) convened  the <strong>2012 Consumer Health IT Summit</strong> on September 10 in downtown  Washington, DC. At this event, various stakeholders learned about ONC&rsquo;s  strategies for engaging consumers, federal initiatives to liberate health data,  as well as stories of success and innovation in the private sector.</p>
      <p>        One particular panelist helped to embody these  efforts by sharing his story and the powerful impact access to data has had on  his own health care.</p>
      <p>        Watch Randy Watson, a veteran, explain how he  Blue Buttons.</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CEARaN9aRr4?rel=0" frameborder="0" title="Blue Button: The Early Days - 2012 Consumer Health IT Summit"></iframe><p>
        (Watch the whole video or skip to 11:58 to see Peter  Levin and Randy Watson discuss Blue Button).</p>
      <p>        Themes and takeaways from the Summit emphasize  progress and innovation, but also challenge all stakeholders and consumers  (yes, you included) to address and consider ways to improve and advance health  information technologies for better patient-centered care, health, and overall  wellbeing.</p>
      <p>        Thoughts and key quotes to consider from the  morning panels (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u4oWdIM53U&amp;feature=relmfu">watch now  on YouTube</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>) and the afternoon concurrent session I attended (&quot;Reaching  Audience Effectively: Outreach, Engagement and Communications for Consumers and  Others&quot;) include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;Preliminary reports show 84 percent of the       population thinks that their doctors are already using electronic health       records. Ninety percent of the population says that being able to download       their own information is important.&quot;&mdash;<em>Brad Hesse, Branch Chief in       the Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch, NCI</em></li>
        <li>&quot;There is a wide misperception that the Health       Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) is a barrier that       prohibits physicians from sharing health records with the patient. HIPPA       is a valve, not a blockage; HIPAA is meant to regulate health information       so that it is used for the benefit of the patient and for no other       purpose. That is it.&quot;&mdash;<em>Leon Rodriguez, Office for Civil Rights, HHS</em></li>
        <li>&quot;Providers are stewards of information but can       help to provide access to their patients&quot;&mdash;<em>Conference participant</em></li>
        <li>&quot;Stop throwing acronyms at the patients.&quot;&mdash;<em>Conference       participant</em></li>
        <li>&quot;Translate the information in the electronic       health record in a way that I can understand it so I can engage with       it.&quot;&mdash;<em>Conference participant</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Were you able to watch the live videocast or did  you follow our live coverage on Twitter? We would love to hear from you. What  are your thoughts on consumer engagement with HIT?</p>

<h2 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding Healthcare  Innovation: Q &amp; A with Alex Fair, CEO of MedStartr</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 11-13-2012<br />
        <strong>Kasia Galica</strong><br />
        National Cancer Institute</p>
      <p>        In this ICH Blog post, we spotlight <a href="http://www.medstartr.com/">MedStartr</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> a new health-related  crowdfunding platform. Crowdfunding for health-related projects is an  innovative idea that enables the consumer to decide what health information  technology applications or devices are important and ready to come on the  market. Approaching the consumer&mdash;patients, providers, and families alike&mdash;from  this angle can potentially give new meaning to the notion of active  participation in health.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What is MedStartr?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex:</strong> MedStartr is a health-specific crowdfunding platform that  enables people with ideas or products to be supported by their potential  customers. People fund or &quot;back&quot; projects that matter to them. In  return the &quot;backers&quot; of the project can get a reward such as the  product itself, or something symbolic like a T-shirt, wrist band, or a thank  you on a public place. In some cases, non-profits get involved and enable  tax-deductible contributions as well. This support&mdash;typically first from  patients, friends, and family&mdash;can lead to a wave of support that may end with  partnerships, venture backing, and even sometimes outright acquisitions of the  companies. When people really care about an innovative solution or product on  MedStartr they can help bring a product to market faster, fund a clinical  trial, or start organizations that produce the change that they want to see. It  truly puts the power in the hands of the people.<br />
        The quintessential example of crowdfunding is a  project that originated on Kickstarter. An engineer developed a watch that  talked to your iPhone. He called it the Pebble and wanted to do a production  run, so he started a project to see if he could sell 5,000 of these before he  even had the product. He raised about $10 million and broke records.</p>
      <p>        MedStartr did not invent or popularize  crowdfunding. That honor goes to sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter.  Unfortunately, health-related projects don't do very well on the former and are  not allowed on the later. I discovered this in April when I went to put my  FairCareMD project onto one of these leading platforms. FairCareMD is an open  network for getting care at a fair price, something hundreds of thousands of  Americans have used that we never charged for. We had our next version loaded  up, but needed to raise funds to add more servers and wanted to experiment with  pricing models. Faced with the likely rejection and failure on Kickstarter or  Indiegogo, I called my friend and FairCareMD co-founder Mike Pence, who also  happened to be the original development lead for Kickstarter. A few days later,  we launched an <em>alpha</em> (early version) of MedStartr and sent it  to a few dozen friends. They liked it so much they funded the next version, and  several asked if they could use it too! We launched the <em>beta</em>(slightly  better version) on Independence Day 2012 and had our first 100,000 views and  three successful projects a few weeks later. We have not looked back since and  have helped a dozen companies find customers, partners, and funding to the tune  of hundreds of clients and millions of dollars.</p>
      <p>        While some projects might work well on  Kickstarter, health-related projects are more appropriate for platforms such as  MedStartr. Using various social media platforms, our projects bring in a whole  community of people that are all about health care innovation&mdash;not just  entrepreneurs, but leaders of big corporations and government. These  stakeholders come in and fund projects. It starts a chain reaction when you get  good projects that bring in good press, and bring in more people to fund the  care that they care about.<br />
        The things that can happen with crowdfunding are  incredible. It is fast and can engage not just a couple of people around the  country who have large sums of money, but <strong>everybody</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What would you say is the primary mission of  MedStartr?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex:</strong> The single mission at MedStartr is to help enable better  health outcomes through innovation that is developed faster and better than  ever. Our clients embody this mission in myriad ways across every disease,  every aspect of care, and every scenario. From rare diseases like <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/fibromuscular_dysplasia/fibromuscular_dysplasia.htm">fibromuscular  dysplasia</a> (FMD) to <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast">breast cancer</a>, we have  projects designed to advance care, improve support, and save lives.</p>
      <p>        A great example is the <a href="http://www.jibonhealth.com/tampostat/">Tampostat</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> project  that was developed by a small team at Columbia University. Their product can save  over 100,000 women each year from dying due to postpartum hemorrhage after  giving birth. Even more amazing, it is simple to use, costs less than $10 to  manufacture, and can be used hundreds of times for pennies per use. This is  just one of dozens of awe-inspiring ideas that you can find and fund on  MedStartr today. We have also helped fund conferences about healthcare, a  medical mission to the Dominican Republic, a &quot;GPS&quot; for healthcare, a <a href="http://www.medstartr.com/projects/31-reconstruction-bras-for-breast-cancer-survivors-and-previvors">better  bra</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> for women with breast cancer, an iPhone app that helps kids deal  with diabetes and stay well, and many more.</p>
      <p>        The goals of our projects are many, but our  mission is simple &mdash; help more people live longer, better lives through  innovation in healthcare.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Where does patient/consumer engagement come  into play here?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex: </strong>In our opinion consumer and patient involvement is also essential  to reducing costs and improving care. Patient engagement is the key to success  in crowdfunding. What we find is that when ten or twenty patients stand up and  say, &quot;we want this project to exist,&quot; it attracts the attention of  physicians and partners who will back the projects, select them as partners, or  in some cases buy or invest in the startup to enable the next stage. It all  starts with patients, though, so even if they are just &quot;liking&quot; the  project or giving a few dollars for a T-Shirt, every backing counts. Patients  are showing that they can have a profound effect on what products get to market  and how fast.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What are some of the early successes of  MedStartr?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex:</strong> We have been very fortunate. Of our first fifteen projects,  7 met their goal on the site and 6 more have had amazing things happen offsite  (big partnerships, investments, acquisitions, grants, and more.) Over 70  percent of our projects are getting found and funded faster on MedStartr. This  is astounding, even to us.</p>
      <p>        The first successful project was by David Chase  who created <a href="http://www.medstartr.com/projects/13-avado-patient-relationship-management">Avado</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>  a patient relationship management system that provides health professionals  with collaborative care tools to deliver care to their patients while they are  outside of the clinical setting. He developed four partnerships, received two  grants, and was accepted into the <a href="http://www.startuphealth.com/">Startup  Health Program</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>  MedStartr itself is another example as we crowdfunded  ourselves on the site and every day are improving it thanks to the support,  suggestions, contributions, and sharing by people all over the world. Another  project called <a href="http://www.medstartr.com/users/65-fmdchat">FMDChat</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>  by rare disease patient Sarah Kucharski, successfully raised seed funding for a  new nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting those affected by FMD.  Artist and patient advocate Regina Holliday raised over $15,000 for a new  conference called Partnership  With Patients. The real success is that we have found a way to help great  ideas, projects, and tools get off the ground and into the hands of people that  need them.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Beyond these significant accomplishments,  what are some of the struggles that MedStartr has had to face?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex:</strong> As a startup ourselves, we also have limitations. It's  challenging to deal with a project that is not getting significant support. A  great crowdfunding project needs time and attention and every &quot;overnight  success&quot; has many hours of burning the midnight oil behind it. We coach  and help our clients as much as we can, but there are limits. Even with good  engagement, some people just don't want the solution offered. This can be hard  to take. For myself personally, my own FairCareMD project came as a disappointing  struggle. I put it up on MedStartr but wasn't able to invest enough effort into  promoting it because MedStartr itself was taking all my time. As a result, it  didn't get funded through the site. This was disappointing, but through this  process we learned the true value of our MedStartr site&mdash;creating awareness. So  for example, even though FairCareMD did not reach its original funding goals,  traffic to the site quintupled and has helped bring more doctors and patients  into the platform. We needed to change the business model a little, but not  everyone is willing to pivot based upon feedback from the &quot;crowd.&quot; As  advisors and mentors to many of our clients, we encourage companies to be  flexible and be ready to adapt to what their customers really want.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What are some other lessons you've learned  thus far?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex</strong>: One of the most important lessons so far is that crowdfunding  isn't just about raising money; it is about raising awareness, adoption, and  starting a conversation that leads to many great outcomes. Jen Dyer's project  is a great example of this. Dr. Jen Dyer is an endocrinologist and the creator  of <a href="http://www.endogoal.com/">EndoGoal</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002194/">diabetes</a> control  mobile phone application. She received feedback from people that loved what she  was saying and doing but wanted something a little different. For example, one  user said, &quot;This is a great app, and would be even better if it was  coupled with remote monitoring that would plug in results from a glucometer/USB  attachment.&quot; We connected Dr. Dyer with our friends at Agamatrix,  developing an automated <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003482.htm">blood glucose</a> meter.  Then we helped navigate the FDA regulation process for the &quot;sidecar&quot;  application and a new partnership was formed. What we learned is that we can  help companies achieve their goals very rapidly by enabling direct feedback,  partnerships, and new thinking that promotes success.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: So there is crowdsourcing as well as  crowdfunding going on here?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex:</strong> The idea for MedStartr was first proposed during a  healthcare <a href="http://www.meetup.com/health20nyc/photos/2638651/?photoId=&amp;photoAlbumId=2638651">gameification</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> flash  mob that we did back in March when my friend Thor Ernsstson (formerly of Zynga)  was in town. In addition to the overall concept, we used 99designs.com for our  logo and crowdsourced everything from business planning to bug testing. Now,  all MedStartr projects get the benefit of crowdsourcing as well as  crowdfunding. Monthly showcases by topic and challenges bring in great ideas  that we help prepare as projects on the site in conjunction with a  &quot;crowd&quot; of mentors expert in every aspect of healthcare innovation.  What we call &quot;crowdhelping&quot; begins with a thorough clinical review to  ensure scientific validity and includes marketing, videography, business  design, PR planning, IP review, and input from some of the best minds in  healthcare. Finally, almost all promotion is crowd-based as we rely on every  visitor or backer to share projects across their social networks, spreading  great ideas virally. Innovators on MedStartr are well supported by our crowds  of patients, physicians, scientists, and experts in every field. We've found  this to be a powerful approach.</p>
      <p>        When you can simply imagine a solution and find  yourself surrounded by a team of world experts to get the idea off the ground,  innovation can happen faster and better than ever. We remove many barriers to  innovation and enable the imagination of the crowd to work on the challenging  problems of healthcare. Any patient, anywhere, right now, in two hours or less,  can create a great MedStartr project and impact healthcare if enough people  believe in it. Our showcases and challenges encourage this, attracting and  enabling new ideas around important topics such as maternal health, aging and  Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes care.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What are the next steps for MedStartr?</strong> <br />
        <strong>Alex:</strong> MedStartr has had a fabulous start, but it is only the  beginning. In October, we declared war on maternal mortality and morbidity with  the launch of our <a href="http://www.medstartr.com/Millionmothers">Saving  a Million Mothers</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> projects. Seven projects have been launched, with  two fully funded to help women live longer and better lives. November is <a href="http://blog.medstartr.com/post/33993932744/call-for-aging-gracefully-projects">Aging  Gracefully</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> month, and December will be focused on diabetes and  devices. We have a story written about us somewhere a few times a week, and  projects all across the health tech, biotech, and medical device spectrum are  being listed every day. We know we can do more and are planning challenges and  events around the world to bring the crowd to crowdfunding. Finally, in  December we intend to launch our equity investing platform for successful  projects on MedStartr for accredited investors based on recent federal  legislation. We want to be ready to help everyone get involved in helping to  create and fund the care innovations that they care most about at a whole new  level.</p>
      <p><strong>Thanks for your time, Alex.</strong> </p>
      <p>        Thanks for your interest in our story. It  unfolds every day and we are inspired by the amazing people we get to work  with.</p>

<h2 id="striving">Striving for Better &amp; More  Accessible Delivery of Information: HHS Digital Strategy</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 11-25-2012<br />
        <strong>Kasia Galica</strong><br />
        National Cancer Institute</p>
      <p><strong>Q &amp; A</strong> with Richard Stapleton, Deputy Director Web Communications  and New Media at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</p>
      <p>        Today's remarkable combination of smart mobile  devices, interactive collaboration tools, and cloud computing is greatly  influencing the way consumers interface with information. The Federal  Government is addressing new expectations by working to deliver and receive  digital information and services anytime, anywhere and on any device. The  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) devised a new? <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/web/governance/digital-strategy/index.html">Digital Strategy</a> to seize  emerging opportunities to engage consumers in the digital age.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What is the HHS Digital Strategy?</strong> <br />
        Richard: The HHS Digital Strategy is an  initiative with a &quot;free the data&quot; approach aimed at increasing the  liquidity of information. This effort encompasses all of the traditional  topic-specific '.gov' websites. It also includes all forms of data sharing,  communication, social media, and third party application programming interfaces  (APIs) that allow for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-mashups/index.html">mashups</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>&mdash;all  the while recognizing the growing usage of smart phones and tablets for the  flow information. Instead of focusing on processes to improve information  technology (IT), the Digital Strategy focuses on 3 outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable the American people and an increasingly  mobile federal workforce to access information and services anywhere, anytime,  on any device.</li>
        <li>Deliver digital services to the American people  smartly, securely, and affordably.</li>
        <li>Unlock the power of government data to spur  innovation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The overarching goal is to present information  for consumers in a way that is fully accessible to them, written in plain  language, and brought together in ONE portal.</p>
      <p>        A Google search on a health topic yields  thousands of hits&mdash;each one of which can only present a piece of the total  picture. Right now the public is playing <em>Where's Waldo?</em> with  health information. Our end goal is to create comprehensive topic-based  websites that are available in traditional and mobile formats with all the  pertinent, reliable, and accurate information found in one place.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What have been some early successes of the  HHS Digital Strategy?</strong> <br />
        Richard: One of the great success stories is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/">flu.gov</a> which deals strictly with  influenza, the flu virus. When <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/">H1N1</a> hit and  eventually turned into a pandemic, flu.gov was already up and running. We had  all the information in one convenient place when all of a sudden the evening  news, online news articles, and the newspapers exploded with stories about the  flu and its spread. The content was there and the visitation to the site was  extraordinary&mdash;so it proved its worth at that time as a central source for  flu-related information. Another example is <a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/">foodsafety.gov</a>. This cooperative website  brings together food safety information, recalls, and alerts across <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/">HHS</a>, <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">USDA</a>, and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">FDA</a> all in one convenient place. Accessible  from a smart phone or tablet, you can get the latest updates on pertinent food  safety issues such as the recent salmonella outbreak in peanut butter on  demand.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What are some challenges or barriers to  implementing this initiative?</strong> <br />
        Richard: It's a complicated process. For  example, we're working on launching a topic specific website on tobacco by the  end of the year. We came up with an inventory of 1,100 websites all related to  smoking: how-to quit, the health effects of smoking, how-to not start smoking.  You name it, it's out there. Not only is there countless information, it also  spans a number of major divisions across the federal government. To scan and  pull all that information into one platform is a major undertaking requiring  the coordinated efforts of many stakeholders on the project.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What are the potential implications of the  Digital Strategy for health related research?</strong> <br />
        With this initiative we take data and research  that we have and make it publically available in a format that is not only  readable but usable by data and technology innovators for relevant <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-mashups/index.html">mashups</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>.  Using an application programming interface (API), the data can be accessed,  applied to population or mapping tables, and presented to create new relevant  information or create new opportunities for further research. Making the data  available for developers, researchers, and organizations pushes innovation  forward and helps to highlight gaps in research.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What are the benefits of the Digital Strategy  for the consumer and the government?</strong> <br />
        Richard: Specifically valuable to us internally  is that we can weed out inconsistencies amongst the information scattered  across the internet. We find that for whatever reason, some websites have  different information. It may be that the content was written at different  times and hasn't been updated to match the knowledge that is available now.  Finding inconsistent information can be frustrating, misleading, and  potentially health-threatening for the consumer. The HHS Digital Strategy seeks  to synthesize all the information and deliver the right information to the  consumer in a consistent manner.</p>
      <p>        We also reach out to the public to give us  feedback on how to improve the Digital Strategy and ensure we're reaching our  intended goals. We have a very interactive blog and pursue an active dialogue  on the comments we receive.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What are the next steps for the HHS Digital  Strategy?</strong> <br />
        We've had a great start to this initiative and  will continue to engage consumers&mdash;utilizing their opinions and feedback to  reach our end goals.</p>
      <p>        I like to use a supermarket model to explain the  current state of affairs of information on the web. When you go into a supermarket  you can expect that the groceries will be organized by the product, regardless  of the manufacturer. If you're looking for cereal, you know that one aisle will  have all the cereal&mdash;it doesn't matter if it's made by Kellogg or General Mills,  or whomever. Right now it's like a trailer truck of grocery cargo dumped all  the boxes of food on the highway and we have to sort through it ourselves.  People shouldn't need to know <em>who</em> owns the information on  tobacco, food safety, the flu, bullying, or cancer. That information should be  grouped together in one reliable place and easily accessible on a desktop,  laptop, tablet, or smart phone. We're working to make that possible.<br />
      </p>

<h2 id="ich">ICH Website Retired After Three  Active Years</h2>
      <p>        Posted on 01-07-2013</p>
      <p>        We want to thank the members of the Informatics  for Consumer Health (ICH) community for your interest and participation in our  mission to bridge the gap between healthcare and information technology by  empowering providers and consumers to manage health care.</p>
      <p> For the past three years your contributions have  had a significant impact on fostering national dialogue and action on the state  of informatics for consumer health. Your participation on the ICH main website  portal, LinkedIn group, and Twitter handle, has encouraged greater engagement  with this important topic. By sharing your relevant news, resources, and  related content on the ICH platform you have helped disseminate information  crucial for facilitating collaboration to improve consumer health.</p>
<p>        As you may know, our primary  platform&mdash;www.informaticsforconsumerhealth.org&mdash;was inspired by the goal of  nurturing public-private engagement and collaboration with our Federal  Agency partners as initiated by the 2009 Informatics for Consumer  Health: Summit on Communication, Collaboration, and Quality. For the past three  years this platform has been a central meeting place for stakeholders from  various sectors&mdash;commercial IT, government, health care, education and research,  advocacy&mdash;to exchange ideas and resources to bridge information technology and  health care with the goal of improving behavioral support for all consumers.  Changing health-related behaviors is key to improving health outcomes, with the  evidence-base indicating that changes in basic preventive behavior (e.g.  smoking cessation, better diet and exercise, and routine screenings) can lead  to significant reductions in disability and death due to cancer, heart disease,  diabetes, and other diseases.</p>
      <p>        Our original purpose for maintaining an online  rallying place beyond the summit was to help nurture the collaborations that  were just beginning to form for the benefit of patients and general consumers.  We have been gratified over the past three years to see these collaborations  take deep root, and with the formation of the patient engagement initiatives  within the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology, we believe those collaborations will be in good hands. As research  continues to grow on informatics for clinical and consumer health, we plan to  transition the content from ICH to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) <a href="/brp/hcirb/index.html">Health Communication  Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) webpage</a>. The ICH website will no longer  be updated on this domain but related efforts will remain a priority for NCI  and our agency partners.</p>
      <p>        Based on the principle of public-private  collaboration, consumer health information technology (health IT) holds great  promise for encouraging and supporting behavior change. As the science and  practice of behavioral and public health informatics evolve, new challenges in  translational science such as engagement, design, funding, and evaluation will  require attention. To this end, the activities and initiatives frequently  presented on the website will continue. New challenges, events, and funding  opportunities are sprouting all across the federal landscape. We hope you  continue to stay engaged with us on the ICH Twitter handle, LinkedIn group  page, and NCI&rsquo;s <a href="/brp/hcirb/index.html">HCIRB  website</a>.</p>
      <p>        We would love to hear your feedback. Please  share with us how the ICH platform has helped you to collaborate or facilitate  your goals for improving consumer health. If you would not like to receive  future updates on the evolution of our cross-agency efforts in informatics for  consumer health, please <a href="mailto:kasia.galica@nih.gov?subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20ICH%20Alert%20Service&amp;body=Please%20remove%20me%20from%20the%20ICH%20Alert%20Service">click  here to opt-out</a>.</p>
