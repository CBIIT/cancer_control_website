         <p><a name="app" id="app"></a><strong>APPLICATION STEPS</strong></p>
         <p><strong><a name="register" id="register"></a>Step 1.  Register Your Organization and Principal Director/Investigator</strong></p>
         <p>A one-time registration is required for institutions/organizations at both:</p>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="http://www.grants.gov/GetStarted" target="_blank">Grants.gov</a>; and</li>
           <li><a href="http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt/preparing.htm" target="_blank">NIH eRA Commons </a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>PD/PIs should work with their institutions/organizations to   make sure they are registered in the NIH Electronic Research   Administration (eRA) <a href="https://commons.era.nih.gov/commons/" target="_blank">Commons</a>.</p>
         <p>Several additional separate actions are required before an   applicant institution/organization can submit an electronic application,   as follows:</p>
         <p>1a) Organization/Institutional Registration in <a href="http://www.grants.gov/applicants/get_registered.jsp" target="_blank">Grants.gov/Get Started</a></p>
         <p>Your organization will need to obtain a <a href="https://eupdate.dnb.com/requestoptions/government/ccrreg/" target="_blank">Data Universal Number System (DUNS)</a><a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="../../images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> number and register with the <a href="http://www.bpn.gov/ccr/scripts/index.html" target="_blank">Central Contractor Registration (CCR)</a> as part of the Grants.gov registration process.</p>
         <p>If your organization does not have a Taxpayer Identification   Number (TIN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN), allow for extra   time. A valid TIN or EIN is necessary for CCR registration.</p>
         <p>The CCR also validates the EIN against Internal Revenue   Service records, a step that will take an additional 1 to 2 business   days.</p>

         <p>1b) <a href="https://commons.era.nih.gov/commons/registration/registrationInstructions.jsp" target="_blank">Organization/Institutional Registration in the eRA Commons</a></p>
         <ul>
           <li>To find out if an organization is already registered in the Commons, see the &quot;<a href="http://era.nih.gov/userreports/ipf_com_org_list.cfm" target="_blank">List of Grantee Organizations Registered in NIH eRA Commons</a>.&quot;</li>

         </ul>
         <p>1c) Project Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) Registration in the NIH eRA Commons: Refer to the <a href="http://era.nih.gov/Docs/COM_UGV2630.pdf" target="_blank">NIH eRA Commons System (COM) Users Guide</a>.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>The individual designated as the PD/PI on the application   must also be registered in the NIH eRA Commons. It is not necessary for   PDs/PIs to register with Grants.gov.</li>
           <li>The PD/PI must hold a PD/PI account in the Commons and   must be affiliated with the applicant organization. This account cannot   have any other role attached to it other than the PD/PI.</li>
           <li>This registration/affiliation must be done by the   Authorized Organization Representative/Signing Official (AOR/SO) or   their designee who is already registered in the Commons.</li>
           <li>Both the PD/PI and AOR/SO need separate accounts in the NIH eRA Commons since both are authorized to view the application image.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Note that if a PD/PI is also an NIH peer-reviewer with an   Individual DUNS and CCR registration, that particular DUNS number and   CCR registration are for the individual reviewer only. These are   different than any DUNS number and CCR registration used by an applicant   organization. Individual DUNS and CCR registration should be used only   for the purposes of personal reimbursement and should not be used on any   grant applications submitted to the Federal Government.</p>
         <p>Several of the steps of the registration process could take 4   weeks or more. Therefore, applicants should immediately check with   their business official to determine whether their institution is   already registered in both <a href="http://www.grants.gov/" target="_blank">Grants.gov</a> and the <a href="https://commons.era.nih.gov/commons/" target="_blank">Commons</a>. The NIH will accept electronic applications only from organizations that have completed all necessary registrations.</p>

         <p><strong><a name="ra" id="ra"></a>Step 2. Request Application Information</strong></p>
         <p>Applicants must download the SF424 (R&amp;R) application forms and SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide for this FOA through <a href="http://www.grants.gov/applicants/apply_for_grants.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.grants.gov/applicants/apply_for_grants.jsp</a>.</p>
         <p>Note: Only the forms package directly attached to a specific   FOA can be used. You will not be able to use any other SF424 (R&amp;R)   forms (e.g., sample forms, forms from another FOA), although some of the   &quot;Attachment&quot; files may be useable for more than one FOA.</p>
         <p>For further assistance, contact Grants Info; Telephone: 301-435-0714, E-mail: <a href="mailto:GrantsInfo@nih.gov">GrantsInfo@nih.gov</a>.</p>
         <p>Telecommunications for the hearing impaired: TTY 301-451-0088.</p>
         <p><strong>Note:</strong> Renewal (formerly &quot;competing continuation&quot; or &quot;Type 2&quot;) applications are not permitted.</p>
         <p>2a) Content and Format of Application</p>
         <p>Prepare all applications using the SF424 (R&amp;R)   application forms and in accordance with the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application   Guide (<a href="http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/funding/424/SF424_RR_Guide_General_Ver2.doc" target="_blank">MS Word</a> or <a href="http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/funding/424/SF424_RR_Guide_General_Ver2.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>).</p>
         <p>The SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide is critical to   submitting a complete and accurate application to NIH. There are fields   within the SF424 (R&amp;R) application components that, although not   marked as mandatory, are required by NIH (e.g., <em>the &quot;Credential&quot;   log-in field of the &quot;Research &amp; Related Senior/Key Person Profile&quot;   component must contain the PD/PI&rsquo;s assigned eRA Commons User ID</em>).   Agency-specific instructions for such fields are clearly identified in   the Application Guide. For additional information, see &quot;Tips and Tools   for Navigating Electronic Submission&quot; on the front page of &quot;<a href="http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt" target="_blank">Electronic Submission of Grant Applications</a>.&quot;</p>
         <p>The SF424 (R&amp;R) application is comprised of data arranged   in separate components. Some components are required, others are   optional. The forms package associated with this FOA in <a href="http://www.grants.gov/applicants/apply_for_grants.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.grants.gov/applicants/apply_for_grants.jsp</a> will include all applicable components, required and optional. A   completed application in response to this FOA will include the following   components:</p>
         <p><strong>Required Components:</strong><br />
           SF424 (R&amp;R) (Cover component)<br />
           Research &amp; Related Project/Performance Site Locations<br />
           Research &amp; Related Other Project Information<br />
           Research &amp; Related Senior/Key Person<br />
           PHS398 Modular Budget<br />
           PHS398 Cover Page Supplement<br />
           PHS398 Research Plan<br />
           PHS398 Checklist</p>
         <p><strong>Optional Components:</strong><br />
           PHS398 Cover Letter File<br />
           Research &amp; Related Subaward Budget Attachment(s) Form</p>
         <p><strong>Note: While both budget components are included in   the SF424 (R&amp;R) forms package, the NIH R03 uses ONLY the PHS398   Modular Budget.</strong> (Do not use the detailed Research &amp; Related Budget.)</p>
         <p>All application instructions outlined in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide (<a href="http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/funding/424/SF424_RR_Guide_General_Ver2.doc" target="_blank">MS Word</a> or <a href="http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/funding/424/SF424_RR_Guide_General_Ver2.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>) are to be followed, with the following requirements for R03 applications:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>R03 applications submitted in response to this FOA will   use the NIH modular budget format and &quot;Just-in-Time&quot; concepts, with   direct costs of up to two $25,000 modules or $50,000 in total per year,   and a maximum of $100,000 over 2 or 3 years (i.e., four modules of   $25,000 each in total over the entire award period) being allowed.</li>
           <li>Items 2-5 of the PHS398 Research Plan component of the R03   application may not exceed 10 pages, including tables, graphs, figures,   diagrams, and charts.</li>
           <li>&quot;Introduction&quot; (required for a resubmission application) is limited to one page.</li>
           <li>Preliminary data are not required, but may be included if available.</li>
           <li>R03 Appendix materials may include the mentoring plan,   graphic images of gels, micrographs, etc., provided that the image (may   be reduced in size) is contained within the 10-page limit of Items 2-5   of the Research Plan. No images may be included in the Appendix that are   not also represented within the Research Plan. No publications or other   printed material, with the exception of pre-printed questionnaires or   surveys, may be included in the Appendix.</li>
           <li>Do not use the Appendix to circumvent the page limitations   of the Research Plan. An application that does not observe these   limitations may be delayed in the review process.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Note: While each section of the Research Plan needs to be   uploaded separately as a PDF attachment, applicants are encouraged to   construct the Research Plan as a single document, separating sections   into distinct PDF attachments just before uploading the files. This   approach will enable applicants to better monitor formatting   requirements such as page limits. All attachments must be provided to   NIH in PDF format, filenames must be included with no spaces or special   characters, and a .pdf extension must be used.</p>
         <p>2b)  Appendix</p>
         <p>The following materials may be included in the Appendix:</p>
         <p>Up to five publications, manuscripts (accepted for   publication), abstracts, patents, or other printed materials directly   relevant to the proposed project. <em>Do not include manuscripts <strong>submitted</strong> for publication</em>.   Applicants should refer to instruction guides and specific Funding   Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) to determine the appropriate limit on   the number of publications that may be submitted for a particular   program. Note that not all grant mechanisms allow the inclusion of   publications.</p>
         <ul>
           <li><strong>Publications in press:</strong> Include only a   publication list with a link to the publicly available on-line journal   article or the NIH PubMed Central (PMC) submission identification   number. Do not include the entire article.</li>
           <li><strong>Manuscripts accepted for publication, but not yet published:</strong> The entire article may be submitted electronically as a PDF attachment.</li>
           <li><strong>Manuscripts published, but an online journal link is not available:</strong> The entire article may be submitted electronically as a PDF attachment.</li>
           <li>Surveys, questionnaires, data collection instruments, clinical protocols, and informed consent documents.</li>
           <li>Graphic images of gels, micrographs, etc., provided that   the image (may be reduced in size) is also included within the (stated)   page limit of Items 2-5 of the Research Plan. No images may be included   in the Appendix that are not also represented within the Research Plan.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>As stated before, applicants are cautioned not to use the Appendix to circumvent the page limitations of the Research Plan.</p>
         <p>Applicants are reminded to review this FOA for   program-specific guidance on Appendix material and other application   requirements.</p>
         <p>2c) Letter of Intent</p>
         <p>A letter of intent is not required for this funding opportunity.</p>
         <p>2d)  Plan for Sharing Research Data</p>
         <p>Not applicable.</p>
         <p>2e)  Additional Application Requirements</p>
         <ul>
           <li>The candidate should identify a mentor(s) with cancer   prevention and control research expertise that has NIH grant experience   and is willing to mentor junior investigators in behavioral research.   The mentor is not required to be employed in the applicant &rsquo;s   institution. The candidate should include a mentoring plan that   describes the nature, frequency, and method of mentoring that will take   place through the entire grant period. The plan should provide evidence   of the mentor&rsquo;s commitment to mentoring, as seen in previous mentoring   activities. The mentor&rsquo;s proposed percent effort commitment to the   mentoring plan should also be stated.</li>
           <li>In the budget requests, applicants should include costs   for attendance at a single 2-day grantee meeting in Bethesda, Maryland,   to which they, as principal investigators, will each be invited sometime   during their second year of funding.</li>
           <li>The NIH requires the PD/PI to fill in his/her Commons User   ID in the &quot;PROFILE – Project Director/Principal Investigator&quot; section,   &quot;Credential&quot; log-in field of the &quot;Research &amp; Related Senior/Key   Person Profile&quot; component. The applicant organization must include its   DUNS number in its Organization Profile in the eRA Commons. This DUNS   number must match the DUNS number provided at CCR registration with   Grants.gov. For additional information, see &quot;Tips and Tools for   Navigating Electronic Submission&quot; on the front page of &quot;<a href="http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt/" target="_blank">Electronic Submission of Grant Applications</a>.&quot;</li>

         <p><strong><a name="submit" id="submit"></a>Step 3:  Submit Application</strong></p>
         <p>To submit an application in response to this FOA, applicants should access this FOA via <a href="http://www.grants.gov/applicants/apply_for_grants.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.grants.gov/applicants/apply_for_grants.jsp</a> and follow steps 1-4. Note: Applications must only be submitted electronically.  PAPER APPLICATIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
         <p>Electronic Submission<br />
           Note – NIH requires electronic submission of the SF424 (R&amp;R)   form through Grants.gov to NIH for all R03 grant applications (this new   policy took effect after June 1, 2006.)</p>
         <p>Electronic submission is as follows:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Registration – The NIH electronic submission process requires institutional registration in two separate systems: <a href="http://www.grants.gov/">Grants.gov</a> and <a href="https://commons.era.nih.gov/commons/" target="_blank">eRA Commons</a>.   Project Directors/Principal Investigators also must be registered in   eRA Commons. These registration processes can take up to four weeks   (possibly longer for new organizations) to complete. All registrations   must be in place prior to application submission. For additional   information on preparing for electronic submission to NIH please visit: <a href="http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt/preparing.htm" target="_blank">http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt/preparing.htm</a>.</li>
           <li><a href="http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt/training.htm" target="_blank">Training resources</a> – video library, archived training sessions and other training   resources to learn about the NIH electronic submission process and the   new SF424 (R&amp;R) application</li>
           <li><a href="http://era.nih.gov/ElectronicReceipt/tips_tools.htm" target="_blank">Tips &amp; Tools</a> – resources to avoid common application submission errors</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Applications may be submitted on or after the opening date and must be successfully received by Grants.gov no later than <strong>5:00 p.m. local time</strong> (of the applicant institution/organization) on the application submission/receipt date(s). (See <a href="#3b">Section 3b</a> for all dates.) If an application is not submitted by the receipt   date(s) and time, the application may be delayed in the review process   or not reviewed.</p>
         <p>Once an application package has been successfully submitted   through Grants.gov, any errors have been addressed, and the assembled   application has been created in the eRA Commons, the PD/PI and the   Authorized Organization Representative/Signing Official (AOR/SO) have   two business days to view the application image.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>If everything is acceptable, no further action is   necessary. The application will automatically move forward for   processing by the Division of Receipt and Referral, Center for   Scientific Review, NIH, after two business days. </li>
           <li>Prior to the submission deadline, the AOR/SO can &quot;Reject&quot;   the assembled application and submit a changed/corrected application   within the two day viewing window. This option should be used if the   AOR/SO determines that warnings should be addressed. Reminder: warnings   do not stop further application processing. If an application submission   results in warnings (but no errors) it will automatically move forward   after two business days if no action is taken. Please remember that some   warnings may not be applicable or may need to be addressed after   application submission.</li>
           <li>If the two day window falls after the submission deadline,   the AOR/SO will have the option to &quot;Reject&quot; the application if, due to   an eRA Commons or Grants.gov system issue, the application does not   correctly reflect the submitted application package (e.g., some part of   the application was lost or didn&rsquo;t transfer correctly during the   submission process). The AOR/SO should first contact the <a href="http://ithelpdesk.nih.gov/eRA" target="_blank">eRA Commons Helpdesk</a> to confirm the system error, document the issue, and determine the best   course of action. NIH will not penalize the applicant for an eRA   Commons or Grants.gov system issue.</li>
           <li>If the AOR/SO chooses to &quot;Reject&quot; the image after the   submission deadline for a reason other than an eRA Commons or Grants.gov   system failure, a changed/corrected application still can be submitted   but it will be subject to the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-05-030.html" target="_blank">NIH late policy</a> guidelines and may not be accepted. The reason for this delay should be explained in the cover letter attachment.</li>
           <li>Both the AOR/SO and PD/PI will receive e-mail   notifications when the application is rejected or the application   automatically moves forward in the process after two days.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Upon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness   by the Center for Scientific Review, NIH. Incomplete applications will   not be reviewed.</p>
         <p>There will be an acknowledgement of receipt of applications from Grants.gov and the <a href="https://commons.era.nih.gov/commons/" target="_blank">Commons</a>. Information related to the assignment of an application to a Scientific Review Group is also in the Commons.</p>
         <p>The NIH will not accept any application in response to this   FOA that is essentially the same as one currently pending initial merit   review unless the applicant withdraws the pending application. The NIH   will not accept any application that is essentially the same as one   already reviewed. This does not preclude the submission of an   application already reviewed with substantial changes, but such   application must include an &quot;Introduction&quot; addressing the previous   critique. Note such an application is considered a &quot;resubmission&quot; for   the SF424 (R&amp;R).</p>
         <p><a name="3b" id="3b"></a>3b) Submission Dates and Times</p>
         <p>Application Submission/Receipt Date(s):  April 20, 2008; August 21, 2008; December 22, 2008.<br />

         <p>3c) Intergovernmental Review</p>
         <p>This initiative is not subject to <em><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part9.htm#_Toc54600164" target="_blank"> intergovernmental review</a></em>.</p>
         <p>3d) Funding Restrictions</p>
         <p>All NIH awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the <em><a href="http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/index.htm" target="_blank">NIH Grants Policy Statement</a></em>.</p>
         <p>Pre-Award Costs are allowable. A grantee may, at its own risk   and without NIH prior approval, incur obligations and expenditures to   cover costs up to 90 days before the beginning date of the initial   budget period of an award if such costs: are necessary to conduct the   project, and would be allowable under the grant, if awarded, without NIH   prior approval. If specific expenditures would otherwise require prior   approval, the grantee must obtain NIH approval before incurring the   cost. NIH prior approval is required for any costs to be incurred more   than 90 days before the beginning date of the initial budget period of a   new award.</p>
         <p>The incurrence of pre-award costs in anticipation of a   competing or non-competing award imposes no obligation on NIH either to   make the award or to increase the amount of the approved budget if an   award is made for less than the amount anticipated and is inadequate to   cover the pre-award costs incurred. NIH expects the grantee to be fully   aware that pre-award costs result in borrowing against future support   and that such borrowing must not impair the grantee's ability to   accomplish the project objectives in the approved time frame or in any   way adversely affect the conduct of the project. See the <em><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part6.htm" target="_blank">NIH Grants Policy Statement</a></em>.</p>
         <p><strong>3e) Sharing Research Resources</strong></p>
         <p>NIH policy requires that grant awardee recipients make unique   research resources readily available for research purposes to qualified   individuals within the scientific community after publication (see the   NIH Grants Policy Statement at <em><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part7.htm#_Toc54600131" target="_blank">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2003/NIHGPS_Part7.htm#_Toc54600131</a></em>).   Investigators responding to this funding opportunity should include a   sharing research resources plan addressing how unique research resources   will be shared or explain why sharing is not possible.</p>
         <p>The adequacy of the resources sharing plan and any related   data sharing plans will be considered by Program staff of the funding   organization when making recommendations about funding applications. The   effectiveness of the resource sharing will be evaluated as part of the   administrative review of each Non-Competing Grant Progress Report (PHS   2590). See Section VI.3., &quot;Reporting.&quot;</p>

         <div align="right"><a href="#">Back to Top</a></div>
         <p><strong><a name="vis" id="vis"></a>VISITING PROFESSOR VISA/CITIZENSHIP</strong><br />
           Individuals in the United States on a J1 visiting professor visa and   working at a U.S. institution may apply for a small grant. We suggest   first asking your institution's grants office about its policy.</p>
         <p>PIs and Other Personnel<br />
           The NIH Grants Policy Statement reads: <br />
           Although PIs and other personnel under research projects are not   required to be U.S. citizens, NIH will not intercede on behalf of   non-citizens whose stay in the United States may be limited by their   visa status. As a result, NIH requires the applicant to determine and   indicate, in its application, that such individuals' visas will allow   them to remain in this country long enough for them to be productive on   the project. If a grant is awarded on the basis of this information and   the individual's visa does not allow for such a stay, NIH may terminate   the grant.</p>
         <p>For more information on eligibility, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement: <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2001/part_iia_1.htm#_Toc504811775" target="_blank">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps_2001/part_iia_1.htm#_Toc504811775</a></p>
         <p>Trainees and Fellows<br />
           Citizenship requirements for trainee and fellow eligibility are   addressed in &quot;National Research Service Awards&quot; of the Grants Policy   Statement: </p>
         <p>The individual to be trained must be a citizen or a non-citizen   national of the United States or have been lawfully admitted for   permanent residence at the time of award. Non-citizen nationals are   persons, who, although not citizens of the United States, owe permanent   allegiance to the U.S. They are generally persons born in outlying   possessions of the United States (e.g., American Samoa and Swains   Island). Individuals who have been lawfully admitted for permanent   residence must be in possession of a currently valid Alien Registration   Receipt Card (I-551), or must be in possession of other legal   verification of such status. For example, if an individual is in   possession of the proper validation on his/her passport, a notarized   photocopy of the passport could suffice. Since there is a 6-month   limitation on this validation, it is the responsibility of the   sponsoring institution to follow-up and assure that the individual   received the I-551 prior to the 6-month expiration date.</p>
         <p>An individual expecting to be admitted as a permanent resident by   the earliest possible award date listed in the fellowship program   announcement may submit an application for an individual NRSA   fellowship. The submission of documentation concerning permanent   residency is not required as part of the initial application. Any   applicant selected to receive an award must provide a notarized   statement of admission for permanent residence prior to award.</p>
         <p>Applicants who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence,   i.e., are in possession of an Alien Registration Receipt Card or other   legal verification of such status, should check the Permanent Resident   box in the citizenship section on the face page of the fellowship   application. Applicants who have applied for and have not yet been   granted admission as a permanent resident should check the same box, but   should write in the word &quot;pending.&quot;</p>
