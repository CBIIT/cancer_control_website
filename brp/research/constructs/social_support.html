						<p>Social support is a general rubric that encompasses at least three distinct types of support: perceived support, enacted support and social integration. There are different measures for each of these types of support, and the types are only weakly related to each other (Barrera, 1986; Dunkel-Schetter &amp; Bennett, 1990; Lakey &amp; Drew, 1997). Furthermore, each type of social support displays its own unique pattern of correlations with other constructs and variables, indicating that each type is a distinct construct, i.e., the three types have surprisingly little in common (Barrera, 1986; Lakey &amp; Drew, 1997).</p>
                        <p><strong>Perceived support</strong>. Perceived support (also known as functional support; Wills &amp; Filer, 2001) is the subjective judgment that family and friends would provide quality assistance with future stressors. People with high perceived-support believe that they can count on their family and friends to provide quality assistance during times of trouble. This assistance may include listening to the stressed person talk about troubles, expressing warmth and affection, offering advice or another way of looking at the problem, providing specific assistance such as looking after the children, or simply spending time with the stressed person.</p>
                        <p><strong>Enacted support</strong>. Enacted support reflects the same kinds of assistance just listed, but emphasizes specific supportive actions, whereas perceived support emphasizes the stressed person's judgment that such actions would be provided if needed. Surprisingly, perceived and enacted support are only modestly related (Barrera, 1986; Dunkel-Schetter &amp; Bennett, 1990; Lakey &amp; Drew, 1997).</p>
                        <p><strong>Social integration</strong>. Social integration refers to the number or range of different types of social relations, such as marital status, siblings, and membership in organizations such as churches, mosques or temples. Social integration is most often only weakly related to perceived and enacted support (Barrera, 1986).</p>

                        <div class="row-fluid margin-bottom-list">
						<p><em>Stress and Coping Perspective</em><br />The dominant theoretical perspective in social support research draws from stress and coping theory (Lakey &amp; S. Cohen, 2000). According to this theory (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984; Folkman &amp; Moskowitz, 2004), stress occurs when people interpret situations negatively (i.e., negative appraisals) and stress leads to health problems, in part, insofar as people do not employ adequate coping responses (e.g., problem solving, emotion regulation). Social support promotes health by protecting people from the adverse affects of stress (i.e., stress buffering; Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985). It does so by promoting more adaptive appraisals, more effective coping or both. In theory, social support should only enhance appraisals and coping to the extent that the particular type of social support matches the demands of the stressor (the optimal matching hypothesis; Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983; Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1990). Social integration, perceived support and enacted support play somewhat different roles in the stress and coping model of social support. Enacted social support is hypothesized to influence appraisal and coping most directly. Yet, the receipt of enacted support requires at least a minimum of social integration (hermits will receive little enacted support) and extensive social ties should provide many opportunities for enacted support (Uchino, 2004). An individual's perception of support should reflect her/his history of the receipt of effective enacted support, and this perception should directly reduce negative appraisals of stressors.</p>
                        <p><em>Social-Cognitive Perspective</em><br />An alternative to the stress and coping model is the social-cognitive perspective, which draws from basic research in social cognition and from cognitive models of psychopathology (Lakey &amp; Drew, 1997). This model is primarily geared toward explaining links between perceived support and mental health, and may be relevant to physical health, insofar as mental health is important for physical health. According to this view, negative evaluations of the self, important other people, and negative emotion are linked together in cognitive networks, which influence each other through spreading activation (Baldwin, 1992). That is, negative emotion makes negative evaluations of the self and others more accessible (i.e., they come to mind more easily), and such negative evaluations make negative emotions more accessible (i.e., they are felt more easily and intensely). This view does not rely upon stressful life events or coping as central mechanisms, because negative thinking alone is sufficient to activate negative emotion and vice versa. Supportive social interaction makes negative thoughts and negative emotion less accessible as well as making positive thoughts and emotions more accessible. The model deals with the weak links among perceived support, enacted support and social integration by making reference to social-cognitive research in person perception (Hastie &amp; Park, 1986; Klein, Loftus, Trafton, &amp; Fuhrman, 1992), which suggests that when perceivers judge the characteristics of others (e.g., they judge others' supportiveness), they rarely retrieve from memory the specific past actions of the support provider (e.g., enacted support). Instead, they retrieve the most accessible global judgment from memory (Klein et al., 1992; Lakey &amp; Drew, 1997). Thus, perceptions of support and memory of recent support receipt should not be closely linked.</p>
                        <p><em>Social Control Perspective</em><br />The social control perspective (Uchino, 2004; Umberson, 1987) is well suited to explaining how social integration may promote better health. This model draws from symbolic interactionism (Thoits, 1985) and emphasizes how relationships can help regulate social behavior, including health-related behavior. Social control may work indirectly, such as when an individual regulates her/his own behavior out of a sense of responsibility to others (e.g., children), and directly, such as when "…an individual might remind his or her spouse to avoid using salt because of its effect on blood pressure…" or "…an individual might threaten to leave a spouse because of excessive alcohol consumption" (Umberson, 1987; p. 310). However, at present, such mechanisms have not been documented directly (Uchino, 2004).</p>

						<p>Perceived Support<br />The most commonly used measures of social support are measures of perceived support. In general these measures show consistent and strong relations to mental health, and are often related to many indices of physical health (Sarason, Sarason &amp; Gurung, 2001; Uchino, 2004; Wills &amp; Filer, 2001). Among the most common measures are the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and the Social Provisions Scale. Descriptions of a wide range of other measures of perceived support can be found in Wills and Shinar (2000).</p>
                        <p><strong>The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List</strong>. The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL; Cohen &amp; Hoberman, 1983; Cohen, Mermelstein, Kamarck, &amp; Hoberman, 1985) has both college student (48 items) and general population (40 items) versions, and provides four subscales: Appraisal (e.g., "There are several people that I trust to help solve my problems"); Belonging (e.g., "I often meet or talk with family or friends"); Tangible (e.g., "If I needed a ride to the airport very early in the morning, I would have a hard time finding someone to take me"[reverse scored]); and Self-esteem support (e.g., "There is someone who takes pride in my accomplishments"). Items are rated on a four-point scale with anchors ranging from "definitely true" to "definitely false." The ISEL has excellent internal consistency and good test-retest reliability (Cohen, et al., 1985).</p>
                        <p><strong>The Social Provisions Scale</strong>. The Social Provisions Scale (SPS; Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1987) is a 24-item measure that provides six subscales, Reliable Alliance (e.g., "There are people I can depend on to help me if I really need it"); Attachment (e.g., "I feel a strong emotional bond with at least one other person"); Guidance (e.g., "There is a trustworthy person I could turn to for advice if I were having problems"); Nurturance (e.g., "There are people who depend on me for help"); Social Integration (e.g., "There are people who enjoy the same social activities I do"); and Reassurance of Worth (e.g., "There are people who admire my talents and abilities"). The original version of the scale uses a Likert response format, although other formats are sometimes used (e.g., Cutrona, 1986). There is also a 12-item short form, and a form that refers to specific relationships (Cutrona, 1989). The SPS has excellent internal consistency and good test-retest reliability (Cutrona &amp; Russell, 1987).</p>
                        <p><strong>Construct validity</strong>. The construct validity of measures of perceived support is extensive, as such measures correlate with a wide range of other measures of relationship perceptions (Lakey &amp; J. Cohen, in press). Indeed, measures of perceived support are related to generic relationship satisfaction, intimacy, low levels of conflict, and secure attachment styles (Lakey &amp; J. Cohen, in press). In addition, relationship partners show some agreement about the supportiveness of their relationships -- there is moderate agreement among dyads when rating the supportiveness of their relationships. However, measures of perceived support are also related to a number of constructs typically thought of as reflecting individual differences. As already mentioned, perceived support is positively related to mental health, but in addition is related to self esteem, perception of personal control, extraversion, positive affect and social skills, and negatively related to dysfunctional attitudes (Lakey &amp; J. Cohen, in press). Thus, measures of perceived support appear to reflect both the characteristics of relationships and also the personal characteristics of respondents. When respondents provide separate ratings for each support provider, approximately 15 percent of the variance reflects respondent personality, whereas about 55 percent represents actual relationships (Branje, van Aken &amp; van Lieshout, 2002; Lakey, McCabe, Fisicaro &amp; Drew, 1996). However, this same research indicates that social support is largely a matter of personal taste, and that there is little agreement among observers about the supportiveness of the same providers. Yet, according to the principles of reliability theory (Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda &amp; Rajaratnam, 1972), when respondents make global ratings of their social networks, the measures come to be more highly saturated with personality variance. That is, if respondents' global ratings represent a weighted average of the supportiveness of specific relationships (e.g., Global Perceived Support = (.5) * Support from Relationship 1 + (.3) * Support from Relationship 2 + (.2) * Support From Relationship 3), and if perceptions of each relationship are partly influenced by perceivers' personality, then computing the weighted average magnifies the personality variance present in each relationship when arriving at a global perception. Thus, to maximize the extent to which perceived support measures reflect personal relationships and not respondent personality, social support should be assessed separately for each of the most important relationships, and these scales should be treated separately rather than summed across different relationship partners.</p>
                        <p>Enacted Support<br />Measures of enacted support typically ask respondents to estimate the frequency with which respondents have received specific supportive behaviors (or simply whether or not they have received the behaviors). Descriptions of a wide range of measures of enacted support can be found in Wills and Shinar (2000) .</p>
                        <p>The most commonly used measure of this kind is the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors (ISSB; Barrera, Sandler &amp; Ramsey, 1981). The ISSB is a 40-item measure, using the following response options: "not at all," "once or twice," "about once a week," "several times a week," or "about every day." The ISSB provides four subscales (Finch, Barrera, Okun, Bryant, Pool, &amp; Snow-Turek, 1997), including Directive Guidance (e.g., "suggested some action you should take"), Nondirective Support (e.g., "Expressed interest and concern in your well-being"), Positive Social Exchange (e.g., "Talked with you about some interests of yours") and Tangible Assistance (e.g., "Gave you over $25"). The ISSB has excellent internal consistency and good test-retest reliability (Barrera et al., 1981).</p>
                        <p><strong>Construct validity</strong>. The construct validity of measures of enacted support is not as well established as that for measures of perceived support. For example, measures of enacted support appear to have less consistent and weaker relations to both mental and physical health than do measures of perceived support (Barrera, 1986; Uchino, 2004). Similarly, enacted support has weaker links to self-esteem and other aspects of cognition than does perceived support (Lakey &amp; J. Cohen, in press). Nonetheless, people who report receiving high levels of enacted support express more positive affect and extroversion than people who report low levels (Lakey &amp; J. Cohen, in press). There is, however, some evidence that researchers may not have discovered the circumstances under which enacted support is related to health. For example, Reynolds and Perrin's (2004) study of cancer patients found that enacted support was linked to mental health more strongly when the enacted support matched the desires of the recipients. Similarly, Bolger, Zuckerman and Kessler (2000) reported that enacted support was only related to good mental health when the support went unnoticed by recipients. Other recent evidence on inter-observer agreement also supports the validity of the ISSB. Close relationship partners displayed higher agreement regarding enacted support than they did for either perceived support or personality (J. Cohen, Lakey, Tiell &amp; Neely, 2005). Thus, respondents appear to report enacted support comparatively accurately, but enacted support does not seem to be related as strongly or as consistently to the same kinds of positive relationship and personal characteristics, as is perceived support.</p>
                        <p>Social Integration<br />Measures of social integration typically count the total number of relationships, the number of different types of relationships, frequency of contact with relationship partners, or the number of roles that respondents have, although some also assess additional information such as the percentage of network members who know each other or are related to the respondents (i.e., density). Descriptions of a number of social integration measures can be found in Brissette, Cohen and Seeman (2000).</p>
                        <p>Social Network Index. S. Cohen and colleagues' Social Network Index (SNI; S. Cohen, 1991; Cohen, Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, &amp; Gwaltnery, 1997) is a prototypical measure of social integration. The SNI assesses the number of different types of relationships in which respondents participate, with participation defined as talking to the other person in the relationship (in person or by phone), at least once every two weeks. The SNI lists twelve different types of relationships (e.g., spouse, parents, children, friends, and workmates) and each type of relationship counts for one point. Thus, high scores reflect having a range of different types of relationships, rather than a large number of relationships.</p>
                        <p>Construct validity. Measures of social integration have an impressive track record of forecasting poor health, particularly mortality (Berkman &amp; Syme, 1979; House, Landis, &amp; Umberson, 1988; Uchino, 2004). Beyond these well-documented links, the construct validity of measures of social integration is less well documented than for measures of perceived support. For example, measures of social integration are not closely linked to psychological distress in most samples (Barrera, 1986). However, social integration does appear to be related to extroversion, positive affect and positive health practices (Lakey &amp; J. Cohen, in press; Uchino, 2004).</p>
                        <p>Other Types of Social Support Measures<br />Although researchers have occasionally noted the desirability of assessing social support using behavioral observation, only a small number of such measures have been developed (e.g., Cutrona, Hessling &amp; Suhr, 1997; Pasch, Bradbury &amp; Davila, 1997). One promising observational assessment is the Social Support Behavior Code (SSBC; Cutrona et al., 1997). Trained observers count the frequency of different kinds of supportive behaviors in specific conversations. The specific types of supportive behavior assessed are informational support (e.g., "suggests a course of action"), emotional support (e.g., "expresses sorrow or regret for the distress of [the support recipient]"), esteem support (e.g., "gives positive feedback") and tangible support (e.g., "offers to perform a task directly related to the stress"). The SSBC has good inter-rater agreement (Cutrona et al., 1997), but it has not yet been used extensively in research, and so there is comparatively little information about its construct validity.</p>
                        <p>Finally, a variety of scholars have begun using diary measures of social support, in which respondents report support received on a daily basis (Bolger et al., 2000). Diary measures offer the promise of substantially increasing the precision by which day-by-day processes in social support can be measured.</p>

                        <div class="row-fluid margin-bottom-list">
						<p>Social Conflict<br />Measures of social conflict (i.e., interpersonal stress, negative support, social undermining or criticism) are typically associated with poor mental health, raising questions about the extent to which social conflict and perceived support reflect different constructs, i.e., are independently linked to mental health (Finch, Okun, Pool, &amp; Ruehlman, 1999; Okun &amp; Lockwood, 2003). The extent to which social conflict and perceived support are partially redundant appears to depend on measurement procedures. For example, when participants rate spouses, the two constructs appear to be less distinct; when participants rate their social networks more generally, the two constructs appear to be independent (Okun &amp; Lockwood, 2003).</p>
                        <p>Adult Attachment<br />Research on adult attachment style has grown quickly in recent years, and measures of attachment style are related to many of the same mental health variables as is perceived support (Rholes &amp; Simpson, 2004). Theoretically, there is substantial overlap between the concepts of secure attachment and social support, as most descriptions of secure attachment, especially the construct of "internal working models of others," name social support as a defining characteristic (Collins &amp; Feeney, 2004). Although there is not an extensive literature on the relation between social support and attachment, what is available suggests the two constructs are linked in important ways (Collins and Feeney, 2004). Future research will need to outline the extent to which attachment and social support effects are redundant.</p>
                        <p>Relationship Satisfaction and Intimacy<br />Much less work has been conducted on the extent to which social support is redundant with the constructs of relationship satisfaction and intimacy, especially regarding marriage. Yet, it is hard to imagine an important relationship that was perceived as satisfying and intimate but not supportive. Social support theories hypothesize that social support involves a specific type of social interaction, and therefore it is important to show that such interactions make a contribution to health that goes beyond generic relationship satisfaction and intimacy. Preliminary work suggests that the two constructs are closely linked (Kaul &amp; Lakey, 2003; Reis &amp; Franks, 1994), but additional studies are needed.</p>

						<p>The construct of social support has been very useful in understanding mental and physical health, including mortality and some specific illnesses. It is important to distinguish among three different types of social support: perceived support, enacted support, and social integration. Each type is measured differently and the three have different relations to outcomes. For example, measures of perceived support are especially good at predicting mental health, and measures of social integration have an impressive track record in predicting mortality. Thus, selection of a social support measure that is most appropriate for predicting the specific outcome of interest is important.</p>
