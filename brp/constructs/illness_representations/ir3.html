			<p><strong>a) Early assessments and ad hoc measurement of illness representations</strong></p>
			
			<p>Early measurements of illness representations consisted of a mixture of closed and open ended questions.  Open ended questions are often times used by researchers at first to assess the content of an illness belief.  Thus, the use of open ended questions informs scale development for closed ended questions and allows the adaptation of the illness representation construct to a new area of illness beliefs.</p>

				   <li>The <strong>Consequence</strong> attribute can be assessed with the following question: "Do you think your symptom/condition is minor, severe, or life threatening?"  Patients are asked to select the option that best fits their beliefs.</li>
				   <li><strong>Causal attributes</strong> have been assessed with threat-specific causes, often derived from patient interviews or focus groups.  For example, "Please indicate how much you agree or disagree with the following reasons as causes for your symptom/condition."  (Format e.g., 1 = completely disagree; 5 = completely agree). </li>

				 <p><strong>b) The Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ)</strong></p>
				 
				  <p>The popularity of the self-regulation approach among researchers 
                    prompted the development of a measure to systematically assess 
                    the five illness representation attributes with 38 items (Illness

                    Health</em>, 11 431-445. </span>). <strong>Illness Identity</strong> 
                    is assessed with a 12-item core symptom list that is answered 
                    on a four-point Likert scale (1 = never; 2 = occasionally; 
                    3 = frequently; 4 = all of the time). Core symptoms focus 
                    on general symptomatology, such as pain, nausea, breathlessness, 
                    weight loss, fatigue, stiff joints, sore eyes, headaches, 
                    upset stomach, sleep difficulties, dizziness, and loss of 
                    strength. The remaining four illness representation attributes, 
                    cause, timeline, consequences and control/cure are rated on 
                    a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 3 = neither 
                    agree or disagree 5 = strongly agree). The cause attribute 
                    is assessed with 10 items, representing common causal beliefs. 
                    The timeline attribute is assessed with three items. The consequence 
                    attribute is assessed with seven statements. Finally, the

                    studies found strong support for the existence of the six 
                    illness representation attributes. The IPQ can be tailored 
                    for use across many different illnesses by modifying the question 
                    stem and by altering the instructions to focus on the specific 
                    illness under investigation.</p>
				 
				 <p><strong>c) The Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R)</strong></p>
				 
				  <p>The <strong>IPQ-R</strong> was developed to improve the measurement 
                    properties of two of the subscales (i.e., cure/control and 
                    timeline) and to broaden the scope or the original IPQ (<a href="javascript:toggle('ref9');" class="ref_link">Moss-Morris, 
                    Weinman, Petrie, Horne, Cameron, and Buick; 2002</a><span id="ref9" style="display:none;" class="biblio_pop"> 
                    <a href="javascript:toggle('ref9');" class="close_butt"><span style="color: red;">x</span>Close</a><br>
                    Moss-Morris, R., Weinman, J., Petrie, K.J., Horne, R., Cameron, 
                    L.D., & Buick D. (2002). The revised illness perception questionnaire 
                    (IPQ-R). <em>Psychology and Health</em>, 17, 1-16. </span>). 
                    The cure/control subscale now distinguishes between personal 
                    control and self-efficacy beliefs (six items) and treatment 
                    control and outcome expectations (five items). For example, 
                    new items that were added to the personal control scale are 
                    "The course of my illness depends on me;" and "Nothing I do 
                    will affect my illness." New items added to the treatment 
                    control subscale include "My treatment can control my illness" 
                    and "There is nothing which can help my condition." The second 
                    subscale that was improved was the timeline subscale that 
                    now includes 10 items, including those that assess cyclical 
                    beliefs (e.g., "My symptoms come and go in cycles;" My illness 
                    is very unpredictable.").</p>
				 
				 <p>Another aspect of the IPQ-R that was neglected in the original conceptualization is the assessment of <strong>emotional representations</strong>.  
				 Leventhal's self-regulation model specifies that individuals have emotional representations and reactions to the health threat, which might 
				 lead to emotion-based coping behavior.  Consequently, six items assessing emotional representations have been included, such as "I get 
				 depressed when I think about my illness;" "Having this illness makes me feel anxious."  The final addition was a subscale measuring a person's 
				 overall coherent understanding of an illness.  This illness-related "meta-cognition" is measured with five items, such as "My illness is a 
				 mystery to me;" and "I have a clear picture or understanding of my condition."  In total, the IPQ-R consists of 71 items divided into twelve 
				 subscales.  Psychometric analyses were performed on several patient samples, totaling a combined population of N = 711 patients.</p>

                    used eight different illness groups for the validation of 
                    the IPQ-R, including HIV, multiple sclerosis, asthma and type 
                    II diabetes patients. Psychometric analysis revealed that 
                    all of the IPR-R subscales demonstrate good internal reliability. 
                    Cronbach alpha's range from 0.79 to 0.89 for the timeline 
                    cyclical dimension and the timeline acute/chronic dimension 
                    respectively. (<a href="javascript:toggle('ref11');" class="ref_link">Moss-Morris

                    L.D., & Buick D. (2002). The revised illness perception questionnaire 
                    (IPQ-R). <em>Psychology and Health</em>, 17, 1-16. </span>). 
                    Test-Retest reliability was investigated at two time points 
                    over a three-week period. Pearson's correlations ranged from 
                    .46 for personal control beliefs to an average of .85 for 
                    different risk factor attributions, demonstrating adequate 
                    stability for a short time frame.</p>
				 
				 <p>To determine discriminant validity and to ensure that the IPQ-R dimensions are not just reflective of affective dispositions, Pearson's 
				 correlations were computed between the subscales of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS).    Correlations between the two PANAS 
				 subscales and the all of the subscales of the IPQ were generally small to moderate in size, with the most significant relationship between 
				 emotional representations and negative affect (NA) (r =. 54).  This correlation suggested that approximately 29% of the variance of the emotional 
				 reaction to illness was accounted for by trait negative affect.</p>
				 
				 <p>Predictive stability of the IPQ was evaluated with regard to adjustment to illness among MS patients.  Illness representations predicted 15% 
				 of the variance of adjustment to disease controlling for illness severity.   Among the six illness representations, the identity representation was the strongest predictor.</p>
				 
				  <p>The large number of items of the IPQ-R and the associated 
                    time commitment to complete the measure might be perceived 
                    as an impediment to its widespread use. For that reason, Cameron 
                    and colleagues have used a shortened version of the IPQ-R 
                    (<a href="javascript:toggle('ref12');" class="ref_link">Cameron,

                    67, 584-589. </span>) consisting of a shortened version of 
                    the personal control and emotional representation subscales. 
                    The personal control scale uses three of the six items and 
                    the emotional representation subscale uses four out of six 
                    items. The authors report that analyses with data from the 
                    original validation study demonstrated that the two subscales 
                    exhibited comparable discriminate and convergent validity 
                    with questionnaires of other illness beliefs and negative
