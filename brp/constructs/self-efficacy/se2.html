			<h3>Perceived Self-Efficacy for Health Behaviors</h3>
			
			      <p>A number of studies on the adoption of health practices have 
                    measured self-efficacy to assess its potential influences 
                    in initiating behavior change. Often single-item measures 
                    or very brief scales (e.g., 4 items) have been used. It is 
                    actually not necessary to use larger scales if a specific 
                    behavior is to be predicted. More important is rigorous theory-based 
                    item wording. A rule of thumb is to use the following semantic 
                    structure: &#34;I am certain that I can do xx, even if yy 
                    (barrier)&#34; (<a href="javascript:toggle('ref5');" class="ref_link">Luszczynska 
                    &#38; Schwarzer, 2005</a><span id="ref5" style="display:none;" class="biblio_pop"> 
                    <a href="javascript:toggle('ref5');" class="close_butt"><span style="color: red;">x</span>Close</a><br>

                    measurement. Journal of <em>Health Psychology, 10</em>, 633-642. 
                    </span>). If the target behavior is less specific, one can 
                    either go for more items that jointly cover the area of interest, 
                    or develop a few specific subscales. Whereas general self-efficacy 
                    measures refer to the ability to deal with a variety of stressful 
                    situations, measures of self-efficacy for health behaviors 
                    refer to <strong>beliefs about the ability to perform certain 
                    health behaviors</strong>. These behaviors may be defined 
                    broadly (i.e., healthy food consumption) or in a narrow way 
                    (i.e., consumption of high-fiber food).</p>
			
			<p>Nutrition-Related or Dietary Self-Efficacy<br />
                    Dieting, weight control, and preventive nutrition can be governed 
                    by nutrition self-efficacy beliefs. It has been found that 
                    nutrition self-efficacy operates best in concert with general 
                    changes in lifestyle, including physical exercise and provision 
                    of social support. Self-confident clients in intervention 
                    programs were less likely to relapse to their previous unhealthy

                    using an objective measure of nutrition behavior, namely grocery 
                    receipts, demonstrated that the effect of dietary fiber self-efficacy 
                    on fat, fiber, fruit and vegetable intake was mediated by 
                    physical outcome expectations. Nutrition goal setting was 
                    linked to higher dietary fiber self-efficacy and actual fiber

                    to eat more fruit and vegetables as well as outcome expectancies

			      <p>Studies aimed at predicting nutrition in vulnerable populations

			<h3>Alcohol Consumption and Self-Efficacy</h3>

                    designed to measure <em>self-efficacy</em> for resisting the 
                    urge to smoke. Participants were treated in a behaviorally 
                    oriented <em>smoking</em> reduction program. Analyses based 
                    upon SSEQ ratings, carbon monoxide measurements, <em>self</em>-reported 
                    <em>smoking</em> rate, and relapse data supported the predictions

                    five subscales were constructed: <strong>Emotional self-efficacy,

			<h3>Adherence to Medication Self-Efficacy and Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy</h3>
			
			      <p>Poor compliance with recommended treatment may result partly 
                    from patients' experience of adverse side effects, but it 
                    may also be due to a lack of self-regulatory skills. Considering 
                    psychosocial factors, adherence is related to lack of social 
                    support and lack of self-efficacy beliefs about one's ability

                    self-efficacy in the context of the TPB to predict and explain 
                    condom use in young adults at two points in time. Condom use 
                    self-efficacy was designed to measure the extent to which 
                    an individual believes he/she has the confidence/ability to 
                    use a condom, such as "I believe I have the ability to use 
                    a condom the next time I have sex." Results provided some 
                    support for TPB. Subjective norm and self-efficacy emerged

					  <li>I could get condoms if I wanted to.</li>
                      <li>I could put a condom on correctly.</li>
					  <li>I could convince the person I am having sex with that we should use a condom, even if he doesn't want to.</li>
					  <li>I could ask for condoms in a pharmacy.</li>

                    expectancies and perceived self-efficacy</strong> were the

                    referring to the maintenance of BSE (maintenance BSE self-efficacy).

			      <p>Cancer screening might be a first step on the way to change 
                    everyday health behaviors. However, people who enrolled in 
                    a single cancer screening (e.g., lung cancer) do not necessarily 
                    have high self-efficacy regarding behaviors related to this 
                    cancer (e.g., regular screening, quitting smoking). Among 
                    those women who smoked heavily who were asked to participate 
                    in lung cancer screening, almost two thirds were classified 
                    as having low self-efficacy regarding smoking cessation (<a href="javascript:toggle('ref68');" class="ref_link">Schnoll
