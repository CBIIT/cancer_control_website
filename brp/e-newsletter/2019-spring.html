		<p>NIH recognizes there are cases in which a Program Director/Principal Investigator may need to update and/or request an extension of the PI&rsquo;s Early Stage Investigator (ESI) status after the submission of an application. To minimize the need for such manual change requests, while still allowing consideration of ESI status at the time of a funding decision, NIH is now automatically updating the ESI status of an application within eRA Commons under certain circumstances. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-072.html">Details »</a></p>

		<p id="UKclinical"><strong>U.K. clinical trial comparing e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement products for smoking cessation highlighted in NCI&rsquo;s Cancer Currents blog</strong></p>
		<p>In a <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/e-cigarettes-nrt-smoking-cessation-clinical-trial">Cancer Currents</a> blog post, BRP Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=22444270&bioType=stf">Rachel Grana Mayne</a> discussed the implications of  a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699054">randomized control trial</a> published in February in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. The study, conducted in the United Kingdom, examined the efficacy of refillable, tank-style e-cigarettes compared to nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) for smoking cessation; all participants received face-to-face smoking cessation counseling. Smokers assigned to use e-cigarettes quit smoking cigarettes at a higher rate than smokers assigned to use NRT (18% and 9.9%, respectively), but were more likely to still be using their assigned product at one-year follow-up (80% and 9%, respectively). Dr. Grana Mayne explained that study findings will need to be replicated in other settings and contexts. Additionally, the high level of prolonged use of e-cigarettes emphasizes the need to understand their potential long-term health effects.</p>
		<p id="varenicline"><strong>Cancer patients more likely to quit smoking for good with extended varenicline cycles</strong></p>
		<p>A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-quitting-smoking-idUSKCN1PT260">Reuters</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> article featured the work of BRP grantees Robert Schnoll and Brian Hitsman and collaborators. Their <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680852">study</a>, published in <em>Psycho-Oncology</em>, found that cancer survivors may benefit from a 24-week extended cycle of the smoking-cessation medication varenicline, compared to the standard 12-week course. BRP Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1663667&bioType=stf">Stephanie Land</a>, who was not involved in the study, offered comments in the Reuters article, reiterating the importance of smoking cessation in cancer survivors.</p>
		<p id="childhood"><strong>Researchers examining effects of childhood cancer treatment</strong></p>
		<p>A recent <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/treatments-childhood-cancer-can-devastate-lives-years-later-scientists-are-trying">feature article in Science Magazine</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> highlighted the efforts underway to understand and mitigate the long-term effects of treatments for childhood cancer. Among the researchers highlighted was BRP grantee Kiri Ness, who has studied frailty, cellular senescence, and other biomarkers of aging and is a steering committee member of the <a href="/brp/bbpsb/aging-trajectories.html">Cancer and Accelerated Aging initiative</a> led by NCI, the National Institute on Aging, and collaborators. In the article, Dr. Ness discusses her work at St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital and her observations of cancer survivors who appeared much older than they were, inside and out. &ldquo; &lsquo;They look like old people,&rsquo; she remembers thinking about the adults in their 20s, 30s, and 40s,&rdquo; the article says. &ldquo; &lsquo;They have wrinkled skin, they walk slowly, they're weak, they have characteristic gait patterns that mostly elderly people have.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>
		<p id="CRCI"><strong>Three perspectives on cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI)</strong></p>
		<p>BRP Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=2550070">Todd Horowitz</a> was one of three experts who weighed in for a <a href="https://www.neurologyadvisor.com/topics/neurocognitive-disorders/chemobrain-experts-weigh-in-on-very-real-and-growing-problem/">Neurology Advisor article</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> on the phenomenon sometimes called &ldquo;chemobrain,&rdquo; formally referred to as chemotherapy-induced or cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). He explained its cognitive effects and potential underlying mechanisms, recommended future research areas, and offered key takeaways for clinicians. &ldquo;The first thing that clinicians should know is that CRCI … is a real phenomenon,&rdquo; Dr. Horowitz said. &ldquo;A wealth of evidence from patient reports, neuropsychological testing, and structural and functional brain imaging shows changes to brain function that can last months or years after chemotherapy.&rdquo; <a href="/brp/bbpsb/cognitive-changes/perception.html">Read about BRP&rsquo;s work and interest in CRCI »</a></p>

		<p id="bias"><strong>Emotion, information gaps, and multi-person decision-making may bias affective predictions in palliative care</strong></p>
		<p>Recent BRP fellow <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=24591334&bioType=flw">Erin Ellis</a> led a conceptual review paper with BRP Program Directors <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439021&name=Rebecca-Ferrer&bioType=stf">Rebecca Ferrer</a> and <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1618&name=Wendy-Nelson&bioType=stf">Wendy Nelson</a>, BRP Senior Scientist <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=3501713&name=Jerry%20-Suls&bioType=stf">Jerry Suls</a>, and extramural collaborators. They describe how affective predictions, or what people think they and others will feel in the future, may serve as a barrier to optimal palliative care delivery. Their systematic search found that affective predictions in the palliative care context &ldquo;are complicated by intense emotions, inadequate prognostic information, involvement of many individuals, and cancer's effect on non-health life domains.&rdquo; The authors suggest that applying decision-science frameworks may help promote early integration of palliative care services.</p>

		<p id="depression"><strong>Depression may make exercise feel more difficult</strong></p>
		<p>In a study of 106 post-surgery breast cancer patients, BRP <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/granteeProfile.do?contactId=1888434&grpId=52812">Featured Grantee Janice Kiecolt-Glaser</a> and collaborators measured self-rated exertion and heart rate during an exercise test, and evaluated the women for depression. They found that women with elevated depressive symptoms rated exercise as more difficult than women without them did, despite the groups&rsquo; having similar heart rates. Their findings &ldquo;support the use of depression screening tools following breast cancer surgery to identify and intervene on individuals at risk for decreased physical activity during survivorship.&rdquo;</p>

		<p id="older"><strong>Older patients willing to trade quality of life for survival are more likely to express 100% certainty they&rsquo;ll be cured</strong></p>
		<p>A team including BRP grantees Supriya Mohile, Ronald Epstein, Paul Duberstein, and the late Arti Hurria sought to examine the prevalence and correlates in older patients with advanced cancer of absolute certainty about curability (ACC), or the 100% belief that their cancer would go away and never come back. They found that 5.3% of the 524 assessed patients reported ACC, and that it &ldquo;was more common among patients who were willing to trade [quality of life] for survival.&rdquo;</p>

		<p id="decisions"><strong>Support, funding drive decisions to continue, end prevention programs</strong></p>
		<p>BRP grantee Ross Brownson and collaborators conducted a cross-sectional study of 400 local public health practitioners in Australia, Brazil, China, and the United States to describe the occurrence of mis-implementation, or &ldquo;the premature termination or inappropriate continuation of public health programs,&rdquo; specifically looking at evidence-based chronic disease prevention programs. They found that decisions to continue or end such programs were often based on program popularity and funding rather than on effectiveness. They recommend improvements to programmatic decision-making policies and practices, as well as future studies on the various drivers of mis-implementation. </p>

		<p>How does online media coverage of U.S. government-funded journal articles on cancer vary by cancer type and stage of the cancer control continuum? How does the amount of funded research published for each cancer type and the amount of media attention each receives compare with its disease prevalence rate? BRP fellow <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=26543105&name=Melinda-Krakow&bioType=flw">Melinda Krakow</a> and colleagues conducted a cross-sectional study of 11,436 journal articles and found that just 16.8% (n=1,925) were covered in the media, and that &ldquo;media mentions were not proportional to actual public cancer burden nor volume of scientific publications in each cancer category.&rdquo; For example, breast cancer, which was the most-published-on type of cancer despite causing fewer deaths than lung, colon and rectal, and pancreatic cancers, was also the most-mentioned type in online media.</p>

		<p id="Laws"><strong>Laws may boost adolescent physical activity</strong></p>
		<p>An all-BRP team examined the associations of school neighborhood environment factors and state laws with physical activity (PA) in a national adolescent sample, and how school neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) moderates those associations. They found that on average, high school youth who resided in states with strong physical education (PE) time requirements (i.e., public school districts must provide PE for 90 minutes or more per week) reported significantly higher frequency of physical activity during school hours (0.27 points higher) than those in states with weak PE time requirements. Results were independent of respondents&rsquo; individual, psychosocial, and school neighborhood built environment characteristics and were similar across school neighborhood SES levels. &ldquo;Our findings provide further support for state laws to promote PA in school regardless of school neighborhood SES,&rdquo; wrote the team, which was led by fellow <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=28147322&name=Lilian-Perez&bioType=flw">Lilian Perez</a> and also included Program Directors <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1456&name=David-Berrigan&bioType=stf">David Berrigan</a>, <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439602&name=April-Oh&bioType=stf">April Oh</a>, and <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=51678&name=Frank-Perna&bioType=stf">Frank Perna</a> and BRP collaborator <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=6098881&name=Laura-Dwyer&bioType=stf">Laura Dwyer</a>.

Previous studies describing adult cigarette smokers&rsquo; cessation behaviors have primarily used national-level data, which does not allow for examination of differences at the state level. The study assessed four specific cessation behaviors: interest in quitting; past-year quit attempts; recent smoking cessation; and receipt of a medical doctor&rsquo;s advice to quit. The prevalence of these behaviors varied substantially by state. The observed state-level differences are important because they highlight potential opportunities to help more smokers to quit.  </p>
