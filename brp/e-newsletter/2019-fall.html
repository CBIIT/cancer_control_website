<p id="retire"><strong>BRP leaders Hesse, Suls retire</strong></p>
<p> The end of July saw the retirement of two leaders in the Behavioral Research Program: Jerry Suls, senior scientist in the Office of the Associate Director, and Bradford Hesse, chief of the <a href="/brp/hcirb/index.html">Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB)</a>.</p>
<p> Dr. Suls was appointed as BRP Senior Scientist in 2013. While at NCI, he served as the primary contact for BRP efforts in cancer-related cognitive impairment and as co-lead of the Office of Disease Prevention&rsquo;s Trans-NIH Comorbidity Special Interest Group. Dr. Suls led the NCI-sponsored workshop &ldquo;Sun Safety: Interdisciplinary Perspectives from the Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Science,&rdquo; hosted by the National Academy of Sciences Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences, which culminated in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29117315">a commentary</a> published in JAMA Dermatology. He also was involved in the <a href="/brp/casphr/index.html">Cognitive, Affective, and Social Processes in Health Research (CASPHR) Workgroup</a> and led two of its workshops. During his tenure at NCI, Dr. Suls also served as President of the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research.</p>
<p> Dr. Hesse was appointed Chief of HCIRB in November 2006, after serving as the Acting Chief from 2004-06. While at NCI, he championed several initiatives that evaluate and advance the science of cancer communication and informatics, including the <a href="https://hints.cancer.gov/">Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)</a> and the <a href="/brp/archive/ceccr/overview.html">Centers of Excellence in Cancer Communication Research (CECCR)</a>. He also was involved in the joint NIH-NSF collaboration on <a href="/brp/hcirb/smart-and-connected.html">Smart and Connected Health</a> and the NCI-FCC collaboration titled <a href="/brp/research/launch.html">L.A.U.N.C.H. (Linking &amp; Amplifying User-Centered Networks through Connected Health)</a>. </p>
<p> In recognition of Dr. Hesse&rsquo;s 15+ years of service to HINTS, the Bradford W. Hesse Student Abstract Commendation was established, to be presented to one or more deserving trainees at each HINTS Data Users Conference. The inaugural winners, recognized at the <a href="https://hints.cancer.gov/meetings-trainings/2019-users-meeting.aspx">May 2019 conference</a>, were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jennifer Bowers, Stony Brook University, &ldquo;Indoor Tanning, Sunscreen Use, Cancer Worry and Risk in 18-34 Year Old Americans&rdquo;<strong></strong></li>
  <li>Abdullah Alanazi, University of Alabama at Birmingham, &ldquo;Information Seeking, Tobacco Product Use and Beliefs of Addictiveness and Harmfulness of Electronic Cigarette Use Among the Adult U.S. Population&rdquo;<strong></strong></li>

<p> A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-tobacco-universities/only-one-in-six-u-s-universities-are-smoke-free-idUSKCN1US1YI">Reuters</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> article featured a study led by BRP Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=599385">Kelly Blake</a> on anti-tobacco policies on U.S. university campuses. The researchers found that in 2017, only 16.7% of accredited, degree-granting institutions had 100% smoke-free or tobacco-free protections, and about 26.9% of students and 25.4% of faculty and staff were protected by campus policies and state laws. &ldquo;Smoke-free environments change perceptions of peer tobacco use and de-normalize smoking,&rdquo; Dr. Blake told Reuters Health via email. &ldquo;The only way to fully protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke is to eliminate smoking in indoor workplaces and public places.&rdquo; The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266902">study</a>, which was published in Tobacco Control, also drew coverage from STAT News and from HealthDay, whose article was picked up by <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-07-03/few-us-universities-are-smoke-free">U.S. News and World Report</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>.</p>
<p id="boosts"><strong>Even small boosts in step counts may help lower mortality rates</strong></p>
<p> The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/how-many-steps-should-you-take-a-day.html">New York Times</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> recently wrote about an NCI-funded study that examined whether daily step counts and intensity were associated with lower mortality rates among older women. In the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141585">study</a> &mdash; which was led by recent BRP grantee I-Min Lee and co-authored by former BRP grantee David Bassett, among others &mdash; mortality rates decreased with even small increases in average daily step counts, before leveling at about 7,500 steps per day. The article includes comments from both Dr. Lee and Dr. Bassett, as well as BRP grantee Abby C. King.</p>
<p id="Pediatrician"><strong>Pediatrician-based interventions can help  parents quit smoking</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/smoking-cessation-pediatric-offices">recent  NCI Cancer Currents blog post</a> featured a BRP-funded <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31403675">study</a> of the Clinical  Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure (CEASE) intervention, in which parents  were screened for tobacco use and offered cessation treatment during visits to  their child&rsquo;s pediatrician. &ldquo;We wanted [to develop] a simple system that would  deliver help to parents in a routine and effective manner and wouldn&rsquo;t involve  a lot of the pediatrician&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; Jonathan Winickoff, principal investigator  and BRP grantee, told Cancer Currents. Study co-authors also include current  and former BRP grantees Nancy Rigotti, Deborah Ossip, and Jonathan Klein. At  the end of the two-year study, the smoking rate was down 2.7% among parents in  the intervention group, compared with going up 1.1% among parents in the  control group. &ldquo;Programs like this are a way to intervene with adults while  they are still young and are likely to be motivated to quit because they want  to protect their children,&rdquo; BRP Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439530&bioType=stf">Yvonne  Prutzman</a> told Cancer Currents.

<p id="Dialysis"><strong>Dialysis patients want greater communication on disease, prognosis, and end-of-life care planning</strong></p>
<p> A team including recent BRP grantee Paul Duberstein surveyed 450 adult chronic dialysis patients on their knowledge of their kidney disease and attitudes toward treatment and end-of-life care issues. They found that among those who responded, 71% wished to discuss their quality of life with their nephrologist, 50.4% their psychosocial and spiritual concerns, and 38% their end-of-life issues. These findings can help inform the development of future interventions on patient-provider communication and decision-making. </p>

<p id="Report"><strong>Report on key points for preventing and combating misinformation on social media</strong></p>
<p> In August 2018, NCI hosted an invitation-only working group meeting titled &ldquo;Trust and Misinformation in the Age of Social Media.&rdquo; Participants discussed multiple topics relevant to <a href="/brp/hcirb/misinformation.html">misinformation on social media</a>, including prevalence of cancer misinformation online, consequences, responses to misinformation, and methodological considerations for conducting research on misinformation. In a new report, a team including BRP collaborator <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=16845073&bioType=stf">Anna Gaysynsky</a>, fellow <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=28283339&bioType=flw">Dannielle Kelley</a>, Program Directors <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439602&bioType=stf">April Oh</a>  and <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=993308&bioType=stf">Wen-Ying Sylvia Chou</a>, and recent fellow <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=26163018&bioType=flw">Emily Peterson</a>  summarized five key points that the working group identified for preventing and combating misinformation.

<p id="Disparities"><strong>Disparities in smoking prevalence grow with additional disadvantages</strong></p>
<p> BRP grantee Adam Leventhal and collaborators used 2008-2017 National Health Interview Survey data to examine the associations between smoking status and the presence of six socioeconomic and health-related disadvantages: unemployment, poverty, low education, disability, psychological distress, and heavy drinking for 60 or more days in a year. Results of their study demonstrated that disparities in smoking prevalence were successively larger with each additional disadvantage faced and have widened over the past decade. Dr. Leventhal discussed the team&rsquo;s findings with <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/primarycare/smoking/79380">MedPage Today</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>.</p>

<p id="Earlyage"><strong>Early-age use of e-cigarettes associated with higher odds of other substance use </strong></p>
<p> BRP grantee Sean Esteban McCabe and collaborators studied the sequence in which adolescents started using cigarettes and e-cigarettes and to what extent their initiation sequence corresponded with other substance use (alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs). The team used 2015-2016 data from the <a href="http://monitoringthefuture.org/">Monitoring the Future</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> study, which surveys a nationally representative sample of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students. Their study found that substance use was highest among adolescents who used both cigarettes and e-cigarettes and that using e-cigarettes at an early age was associated with higher odds of other substance use.  In addition, those adolescents who used both cigarettes and e-cigarettes were more likely to report initiating cigarette smoking before e-cigarette use. </p>

<p id="Sociodemographic"><strong>Sociodemographic differences drive tobacco use differences between transgender, cisgender individuals</strong></p>
<p> Using data from Wave 2 (October 2014 to October 2015) of the <a href="https://pathstudyinfo.nih.gov/UI/HomeMobile.aspx">Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health</a> (PATH) study, recent BRP fellows <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=24809765&bioType=flw">Christopher Wheldon</a> and <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=24688383&bioType=flw">Kara Wiseman</a> examined tobacco product use among transgender and cisgender individuals. Compared to cisgender individuals, a larger proportion of transgender respondents reported current use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. However, multivariate analyses found that differences in current tobacco use were not due to gender identity. Rather, they were fully explained by sociodemographic differences between transgender and cisgender respondents, particularly in terms of income and educational attainment. </p>

<p id="multimorbidity"><strong>Special journal issue examines multimorbidity</strong></p>
<p> Health Psychology recently published a special issue titled &ldquo;Multimorbidity in Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine Research,&rdquo; guest-edited by BRP Branch Chief <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=8579&bioType=stf">Paige Green</a> and recently retired Senior Scientist Jerry Suls. Its nine articles suggest ways that health psychology and behavioral medicine can contribute to understanding, preventing, and controlling multimorbidity, defined in the issue as the concurrent presence of more than one chronic health disease or condition in an individual. Topics include relevance, measurement, mechanisms, and interventions for multimorbidity; the representation of multimorbidity in behavioral intervention trials; and guidelines and system-level proposals to improve healthcare for patients with multiple health conditions. Authors include a number of BRP grantees, in addition to Dr. Green and Dr. Suls.</p>

<p id="MOVE"><strong>MOVE! weight management program not sensitive to built environment</strong></p>
<p>Former BRP grantees Shannon Zenk (lead author), Elizabeth Tarlov, Marian Fitzgibbon, and Lisa Powell and collaborators examined whether short- and longer-term effects of the VA&rsquo;s MOVE! program, a structured nationwide weight management program, might vary along with characteristics of participants&rsquo; built environment. They estimated program effects on body mass index (BMI) after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and found that &ldquo;the program effect did not vary significantly across subgroups with different walkability, park access, or fitness facility access.&rdquo; The results did not support the hypothesis that the program complements the built environment, nor the hypothesis that it substitutes for the environment&rsquo;s constraints, they wrote.</p>
<p>Zenk, S.N., Tarlov, E., Wing, C., Slater, S., Jones, K.K., Fitzgibbon, M., Powell, L.M. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330154">Does the built environment influence the effectiveness of behavioral weight management interventions?</a> <em>Prev Med</em> (2019). </p>
<p id="Testing"><strong>Testing physical activity interventions and factors that may affect them</strong></p>
<p> Adaptive interventions allow for adjustments based on individuals&rsquo; performance, and new technologies allow for incentives to be delivered sooner. Few prospective studies have addressed the hypothesis that higher-walkable neighborhoods enhance moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) interventions. Thus, in the WalkIT Arizona study, BRP grantee Marc Adams and collaborators are testing individual-level adaptive goal setting and incentive interventions for MVPA adoption and maintenance among adults from neighborhoods with varying walkability. This report describes their study. </p>

They found that odds of sunscreen use were higher with longer walking duration for both categories, compared to those who reported no walking; odds of sun avoidance were lower with longer-duration leisure but not transportation walking; and the odds of using sun protective clothing were higher for longer-duration transportation walking, but not leisure walking. These variations &ldquo;may provide important insight into strategies to increase sun protection while promoting physical activity,&rdquo; they wrote.</p>

Its new Measures Registry Learning Modules are designed to complement the <a href="https://www.nccor.org/nccor-tools/measures/">Measures Registry</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> and <a href="https://www.nccor.org/nccor-tools/mruserguides/">Measures Registry User Guides</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> to assist researchers and practitioners with choosing the best measures across the four domains of the Measures Registry: individual diet, food environment, individual physical activity, and physical activity environment. The Learning Modules include an overview module and modules for each of the four domains. Each module domain includes a glossary, additional resources, an interactive case study, and short quizzes to enhance classroom learning and understanding of key concepts. The Learning Modules are a great tool for users who are newer to research and evaluation in diet and physical activity, or individuals who need a refresher on key concepts. <a href="https://www.nccor.org/nccor-tools/measures-registry-learning-modules/">Access the Learning Modules »</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a></p>
