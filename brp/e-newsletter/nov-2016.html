   <p id="forward"><strong>Foreword from William Klein, Associate Director of Behavioral Research Program (BRP)</strong></p>
<img src="images/Klein-William.jpg" width="150" height="210" alt="William Klien" class="pull-left">
<p>Greetings from the <a href="/brp/">Behavioral Research Program</a> (BRP). We hope you enjoy this November 2016 issue of <a href="/brp/e-newsletter/">BRP Scientific News</a>. Our program is pleased to share several items of interest with the cancer-related behavioral research community. In July, the institute awarded six grants related to smoking cessation interventions in lung cancer screening settings. We also have a new funding opportunity on affective and decisional processes in cancer control, as well as a reissued announcement on accelerating the pace of drug abuse research. Please review all of our <a href="/brp/funding/funding-opportunities.html">Funding Opportunity Announcements</a>, especially the <a href="/funding-foa-applicants.html">six new announcements released earlier this summer</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve included several program-related scientific advances and a number of resources, tools, and upcoming events in this issue. Highlights include a paper on the rising number of older cancer survivors by one of our Cancer Prevention Fellows, Cancer Moonshot updates, and information about a new smoking cessation tool specifically designed for cancer survivors. </p>
<p>This issue of <em>BRP Scientific News</em> also provides scientific highlights from extramural researchers, as well as staffing and career announcements from the Behavioral Research Program (BRP).

<h3 id="award-annoucement">Award Announcement </h3>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has awarded six grants to support research on the design and implementation of smoking cessation interventions in lung cancer screening settings (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-15-011.html">RFA-CA-15-011</a>). NCI plans to provide a total of $18.4 million to support the projects for five years. In 2013, the <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/">United States Preventive Services Task Force</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> recommended adults ages 55-80 with a 30 pack-year smoking history (who currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years) undergo annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening. Smoking cessation treatment during LDCT screening offers the potential to help reduce tobacco use rates and smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke causes more than 440,000 premature deaths from cancer, heart disease, stroke, and lung disease in the U.S. each year.<br>

        <p>Shirley Bluethmann, Ph.D., a Cancer Prevention Fellow in the Behavioral Research Program, and two DCCPS colleagues, Angela Mariotto, Ph.D., and Julia Rowland, Ph.D., used NCI&rsquo;s <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/">Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results</a> (SEER) data and U.S. Census data to estimate current and projected prevalence&nbsp;of cancer survivors over age 65&nbsp;in the coming decades. Owing to the rapidly aging population, sometimes referred to as the silver tsunami, older cancer survivors could comprise close to 75 percent of the 26.1 million cancer survivors projected to be alive&nbsp;in 2040. Using SEER-Medicare linked records, the authors also assessed comorbidity burden based on age and cancer history, finding the strongest association between older age and greater comorbidity burden. The three most prevalent comorbid conditions among survivors were diabetes, congestive heart failure, and COPD. A significant rise in cancer survivors in older age groups will present challenges to the health care system, social services agencies, federal programs, and caregivers.</p>

<p><strong>Tobacco Control Researchers Involved in Lung Disease Study</strong><br>
    Researchers from the <a href="/brp/tcrb/">Tobacco Control Research Branch</a>, including Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1626&amp;bioType=stf">Mark Parascandola, Ph.D., M.P.H.,</a> will provide expertise and technical support for an upcoming five-year project that will examine the effects of indoor air pollution and whether the availability of clean cooking fuel significantly improves health. The randomized study will take place in India, Rwanda, Guatemala, and Peru. Half of the 3,200 participants – who must be pregnant to participate – will receive liquefied petroleum gas stoves and a supply of gas, and the other half will continue to use the wood, coal, and other solid fuels that are currently used. The researchers will follow the mothers and children until the children are two and will examine a number of health measures, including hypertension, pneumonia, and birth weight. Investigators will recruit an additional group of older women and will monitor them for cardiopulmonary and metabolic outcomes and cancer-related biomarkers. </p>
<p>&quot;This study will measure the impact of a large-scale clean cook stove intervention in a real-world setting,&quot; said Dr. Parascandola. &quot;It will assess the actual adoption and use of the technology as well as the role of environmental factors such as secondhand smoke exposure.&quot; NCI and other NIH institutes and centers are funding the project. <br>

<p><strong>Substantial Progress Made in Reducing Smoking?</strong><br>
    The U.S. age-adjusted prevalence of adult cigarette smoking has decreased an average of 0.78 percentage points each year since 2009. In this perspective piece in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, Michael C. Fiore, M.D., M.P.H., M.B.A., associates this marked decline with several initiatives, including raising cigarette taxes, regulating tobacco products, and mandating insurance coverage of counseling and medication treatments for smoking. </p>

<p><strong>Will Precision Medicine Improve Population Health?</strong> <br>
    Muin J. Khoury, M.D., Ph.D., and Sandro Galea, M.D., M.P.H., Dr.P.H., discuss factors that make precision medicine more or less unlikely to improve population health. Currently, the precision medicine initiative focuses on drug development for personalized treatment of diseases. By marrying biological, social, and environmental determinants of health, precision medicine can enhance collaborations between medicine and public health to develop targeted approaches to interventions in both individuals and populations.</p>

<p><strong>Provider Approach to HPV Vaccine Recommendations Directly Affects Vaccination Rates </strong><br>
    Jasmine Tiro, Ph.D., a former Cancer Prevention Fellow and current BRP grantee, along with several colleagues, conducted a pilot study to examine whether clinicians&rsquo; approaches to recommending HPV vaccination to patients could be contributing to low vaccination rates in Texas, where nearly half of Texas teens fail to get vaccinated. The study analyzed recorded conversations between parents and providers at six Dallas clinics over a 13-month period and found that HPV vaccination was lowest for those receiving only weak recommendations and highest when providers coupled the recommendation with an evidence-based rationale.

<h2>Healthy Behaviors Are Cheapest, Most Effective Course in Cancer Prevention </h2>
<p>Two studies – funded by DCCPS and the NCI Office of Cancer Genomics – have shown the most common cancers can be prevented in part through lifestyle behaviors. In one study, the researchers used epidemiological and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (<a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/">SEER) data</a>, as well as modeling techniques, to show that less than 30 percent of the risk of developing cancer over the lifespan was due to intrinsic risk factors, or &ldquo;bad luck,&rdquo; whereas the majority of risk was due to controllable risk factors. The second study analyzed cancer and lifestyle data from two cohort studies and national cancer statistics and focused on lifestyle behaviors such as smoking, drinking alcohol, physical activity, and obesity. The researchers determined that, across most cancers, 20 to 40 percent of new cancer cases – and about half of all cancer deaths – could be prevented by lifestyle factors such as not smoking or drinking alcohol and exercising more. Funding for this study provided by grant numbers 97132, 168409, P01CA87969, UM1CA186107, P01CA55075, and UM1CA167552. <br>

<h2>E-Cigarette Use Common in Smoke-free Public Spaces </h2>
<p>A BRP-funded study of e-cigarette users showed that nearly three-quarters had vaped in areas where cigarette smoking was not allowed. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 29 were most likely to do so, and people who vaped daily were twice as likely to vape in smoke-free environments compared to those who did so on occasion. The most common venues were bars, restaurants, and worksites. The researchers found that most e-cigarette users did not think e-cigarettes were harmful to themselves or others, so they did not believe the smoking ban should apply.

<p><strong>Differing Expectations About Survival Often Found Between Patients and Oncologists</strong><br>
    Patients with advanced cancer often hold discordant expectations of survival from that of their oncologists. A group of <a href="/brp/tcrb/">Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch</a>-funded researchers recently published a paper to examine the degree to which such mismatched perceptions occur among cancer patients and their oncologists. The cross-sectional study included 236 patients and 38 oncologists. Nearly 70 percent of the patient-oncologist pairs reported survival prognosis ratings that were discordant, with nonwhite patients experiencing discordance with their oncologists to a greater degree than white patients. Among those discordant pairs, though, 89 percent of patients did not know that there were differences between their own estimated chances of survival and that of their oncologist. The researchers concluded that a better understanding of what it means to communicate about a person&rsquo;s prognosis is urgently needed in order to honor that person&rsquo;s values, preferences, and wishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Capstone Held for Network on Biobehavioral Pathways in Cancer </strong><br>
    Five years ago, a handful of cancer researchers with training in molecular biology, psychology, public health, and related fields, set out to study the pathways that link psychological, behavioral, and social factors to cancer. Of particular interest was whether stress and other psychological phenomena caused established tumors to progress and metastasize – and whether behaviors such as exercise or social engagement improved cancer outcomes. NCI&rsquo;s <a href="/brp/bbpsb/ncintwk-biopthwys.html">Network on Biobehavioral Pathways in Cancer</a> was convened to support this emerging transdisciplinary research area. On September 16, 2016, investigators gathered at NCI Shady Grove to present research results from the Network&rsquo;s pilot project program.</p>
