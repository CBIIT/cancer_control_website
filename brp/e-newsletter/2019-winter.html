        <p id="Maintenance"><strong>Notice of  Interest in Long-term Maintenance of Behavior Change Research</strong></p>
        <p> Testing if  and how behavior change is maintained often requires longer-term follow-up than  what can be done within a single NIH grant timeframe. To  encourage that research, a number of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices,  including the National Cancer Institute, are interested in competitive renewal  (type 2) applications that propose continued research with participants from a  previously-funded behavioral intervention to study behavior change. To propose  a project, contact the program director associated with the original grant. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-040.html">Learn more</a>.</p>

The  field has evolved since the definition was created in 1996, and an updated  definition will improve NIH's ability to describe, assess, and monitor NIH BSSR  funding. <a href="https://obssr.ideascale.com/">Submit your input by February 22</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>.</p>

        <p id="Odds"><strong>Odds of cigarette use higher among  gay and lesbian young adults in study </strong></p>
        <p>BRP grantee Carla Berg co-authored a study examining the prevalence of cigarette and alternative tobacco product use among U.S. young adults. The study used data from Project DECOY (Documenting Experiences with Cigarettes and Other Tobacco in Young Adults), a two-year longitudinal study of seven colleges and universities in Georgia. In the study, 34.7% of the men reported use of any tobacco product in the past 30 days (18.6% cigarettes, 12.3% little cigars/cigarillos [LCCs], 16.8% e-cigarettes, and 14.7% hookah), and 25.3% of the women did (10.4% cigarettes, 10.6% LCCs, 7.6% e-cigarettes, and 10.8% hookah). After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, gay or lesbian sexual orientation was significantly associated with higher odds (OR = 1.62 and 1.61, respectively) of cigarette use.</p>

        <p> BRP grantee  Melinda Mahabee-Gittens led a study that examined the feasibility of having  nurses use a clinical decision support system in an urgent care setting to  advise, assess, and assist child caregivers to quit smoking. Of the 149 caregivers  included in the study, study nurses advised 35.2% to quit, assessed 35.9% for  readiness to quit, and assisted 32.4% who wished to quit with follow-up and  cessation resources. At 3-month follow-up (86.6% retention), 58.9% reported  quit attempts, and 7.8% had a self-reported quit. Overall, there was a  significant decrease in nicotine dependence among caregivers and a significant  increase in motivation to quit. </p>
