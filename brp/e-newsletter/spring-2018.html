            <p id="foreward"><strong>Foreword by Bradford Hesse, Chief  of the Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch</strong></p>
            <img src="images/brad-hesse.jpg" alt="Bradford Hesse" class="pull-left" style="padding-right:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">
            <p>When the Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch  (HCIRB) formed at the turn of the millennium, NCI declared an <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget/about-annual-plan/nci-plan-2001.pdf"> extraordinary opportunity</a> to conduct research in cancer communications. The World Wide Web  was new; patients were showing up to their oncologists&rsquo; appointments with reams  of computer printouts gathered from the Web; and the imminent completion of the  Human Genome project was heralding a shift in medicine toward a paradigm that  would be more predictive, preemptive, personalized, and participative than ever  before. However, we knew much more about how to calculate genomic-based risk  predictions than how to <em>communicate those  risks</em> to patients. Although the internet was changing every aspect of  communication in other sectors, we were only at the beginning of understanding  how to use these new electronic capacities to support our patients or  effectively elevate public knowledge and awareness. HCIRB was formed to spur  research in these communication-related areas. To assist the extramural  community in staying ahead of these massive shifts in the health communication  environment, HCIRB launched the Health Information National Trends Survey, or <a href="https://hints.cancer.gov/about-hints/learn-more-about-hints.aspx"> HINTS</a>. </p>
              <p>
            Fast forward to 2018 -- HCIRB is now nearly two decades old, precision medicine is becoming a reality, and Electronic Health Records (EHR) undergird our health care system. Additionally, social media is a global communication force and the use of mobile devices far outstrips the use of telephone landlines in connecting people to the world.</p>
            <p>The HINTS program has monitored each of  those changes over the years and has the led the way at NIH in data-sharing by  making data from each one of its 10 administrations publicly available to the  extramural community for collective analysis. Visit the <a href="https://hints.cancer.gov/"> HINTS website</a> to learn more about the newly released 2017 HINTS data. Co-sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Office of the  National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), these new data  provide cutting-edge insights into how the public is responding to messages  surrounding new tobacco products; how they are using a new raft of  communication technologies in their daily lives; and how responsive they are to  medicine&rsquo;s push toward patient empowerment. Recently, ONC highlighted HINTS in  a data brief about <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-03/HINTS-2017-Consumer-Data-Brief-3.21.18.pdf">how  patients and providers use online medical records</a>. </p>
            <p>Download the data and join the hundreds  of authors whose publications based on HINTS analyses are catalogued through  PubMed and enumerated at the HINTS website. Feel free to download and circulate  any one of the <a href="https://hints.cancer.gov/publications-reports/hints-briefs.aspx"> 35 HINTS Briefs</a> that encapsulate valuable  lessons learned from these papers into focused synopses for cancer-control  planners. More importantly, please join us Sept. 13-14, 2018, for <a href="https://www.scgcorp.com/HINTSConference2018/">the  Fifth HINTS Data Users Conference</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="Exit disclaimer"></a> at  the Natcher Auditorium on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD. The <a href="https://www.scgcorp.com/HINTSConference2018/Registration"> registration</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="Exit disclaimer"></a> and <a href="https://www.scgcorp.com/HINTSConference2018/Abstracts"> abstract submission site</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="Exit disclaimer"></a> are now open.</p>
            <p>Other notable projects from the  past few years include a 2016 President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/pcp-connected-health"> report</a> titled <a href="https://prescancerpanel.cancer.gov/report/connectedhealth/"> &ldquo;Improving Cancer-Related Outcomes with Connected Health.&rdquo;</a> Written in collaboration with our branch&rsquo;s staff, the  report offers members of the cancer community concrete suggestions for ensuring  patients and the public are supported in their connections to the health care  system. </p>
              <p>Most recently, three priority  research areas are especially relevant to our research community. One priority  calls for a better understanding of how connected health can enable effective  teamwork in health care. A second area calls for intervention strategies to  enhance patient engagement in health care. A third priority seeks to use data  from connected devices in ways that enhance clinical care. The branch has developed  several funding announcements to support research into these areas. <a  href="/brp/funding/funding-opportunities.html#hcirb">Read  about these announcements on our funding page</a>.</p>
              <p>
              In our Connected Health report,  one of our most explicit recommendations is for NCI to collaborate with other  government agencies and private partners to ensure that all people receive  equitable access to the benefits of connected health technologies. <a href="#public-private">Read below  to learn more about the inaugural project that aims to bridge the broadband  connectivity gap in rural Appalachia</a>.</p>
            <p>As always, we encourage you to  reach out to any BRP staff with questions, ideas, or concerns, either by email  at <a href="mailto:ncidccpsbrpadvances@mail.nih.gov">ncidccpsbrpadvances@mail.nih.gov</a> or at one of the many conferences we attend. </p>

        <p id="experts"><strong>Experts Collaborate with BRP Staff  to Improve Skin-Cancer Control Efforts</strong></p>
        <p>Improving skin-cancer outcomes is a priority for the BRP, yet sun protective behaviors in the U.S. remain underused. BRP convened a two-day meeting with 19 experts from various fields in 2016 to discuss this topic. The National Academy of Sciences hosted the meeting.</p>
        <p>The team summarized their  discussions in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Interdisciplinary+Perspectives+on+Sun+Safety">January 2018 article in <em>JAMA Dermatology</em> titled  Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Sun Safety</a>. The group discussed knowledge gaps, various perspectives on sun  exposure, implications for skin cancer risk and other health outcomes, and new  directions for the field. Based on their discussions, the researchers  identified five themes that will help improve skin-cancer control efforts in  the U.S.: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The definition of risk must be expanded, and categories for skin physiology must be refined to incorporate population diversities.</li>
          <li>Risky sun exposure often co-occurs with other health-related behaviors. </li>
          <li>Messages must be nuanced to target at-risk populations.</li>
          <li>People at risk for tanning disorder must be recognized and treated.</li>

        <p> <a href="/brp/hcirb/">HCIRB</a> partnered with the Federal Communications Commission to  address the broadband health connectivity gap in rural areas of the U.S. Rural Americans are more likely to die of cancer and report lower quality treatment experiences. They are also more likely to be without broadband  internet. The long-term goal of this partnership is to improve cancer outcomes  by better connecting rural patients to their cancer care teams. </p>
        <p>An inaugural project of the  partnership is the Linking and Amplifying User-Centered Networks through  Connected Health (L.A.U.N.C.H.) project. This public-private partnership brings  together researchers from the University of California at San Diego, the  University of Kentucky, and the biopharmaceutical company Amgen. Using an  implementation science lens, the project aims to redesign access to care using  biosensors, smartphones, patient-reported outcomes, and other techniques to  reduce disconnections between patients and their care teams. </p>

        <p> BRP and  Healthcare Delivery Research Program (also part of the Division of Cancer  Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS)) staff  and fellows conducted a qualitative key informant study. They interviewed 19 health care providers in cancer  clinical trials and found great variation in the way  providers understood the term &ldquo;palliative care&rdquo; and how it is delivered. Major themes related to the meaning of palliative  care included the holistic aspects of palliative care, the importance of  symptom management and care, and the fact that  people often conflate the meaning of  palliative care and end-of-life or hospice  care. The researchers concluded that a standard model for integrating  palliative care into clinical trials is needed. </p>

        <p>HCIRB branch chief Brad Hesse presents his vision for  bringing the open science movement to psychological science research. He defines open science as making publications, concepts, protocols, and data accessible to everyone. He discusses the delicate balance between open data and  the current structures that reward individual productivity. There are also the  practical limitations of where to host large data sets and how to analyze them. Hesse dissects recent initiatives that have used an open science approach. He makes four recommendations to encourage psychologists to use open science within their own communities and spur change in other scientific communities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Nurture innovation and agile learning</li>
          <li>Think outside the paradigm</li>
          <li>Create simplicity from complexity</li>

Using data from the 2014–2015  <a href="/brp/tcrb/tus-cps/">Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey</a> (TUS-CPS), CDC  investigators and TCRB researchers <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1700&bioType=stf">Gordon  Willis</a> and <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1540&bioType=stf">Anne  Hartman</a> analyzed self-reported use of cigars, regular  pipes, water pipes, electronic cigarettes as well as cigarettes and smokeless  tobacco among adults in all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Prevalence of ever-use of any tobacco product ranged from 27.0% (Utah) to 55.4%  (Wyoming), and prevalence of current use of any tobacco product ranged from  10.2% (California) to 27.7% (Wyoming). The prevalence of current use of one or  more tobacco products in addition to cigarettes ranged from 11.5% (Delaware) to  32.3% (Oregon). Differences in tobacco product use across states underscores  the importance of using proven population-level strategies to reduce tobacco  use and expanding these strategies to cover all forms of tobacco marketed in  the U.S. </p>

        <p>TCRB&rsquo;s <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1540&amp;bioType=stf">Anne Hartman</a> and colleagues provided updated estimates on  the mortality risks of exclusive use of cigars and pipes. The researchers used  data from the <a href="/brp/tcrb/tus-cps/">Tobacco Use Supplement  to the Current Population Survey</a> (TUS-CPS), which was linked to the National Longitudinal Mortality  Study (NLMS). They found that current and former exclusive cigarette smokers,  current exclusive pipe smokers, and current exclusive cigar smokers are at  higher risk for tobacco-related cancer death. The data also highlighted the importance of complete cessation to reduce mortality and morbidity from combustible tobacco use. The study emphasizes the need for complete cessation with its finding that nondaily cigarette smokers (as well as daily smokers) are at increased risk for lung and oral cancers, cardio- and cerebro- vascular diseases, and COPD. </p>

The researchers describe communication regulatory science as an emerging field that seeks to inform regulatory actions that promote optimal communication using validated techniques, tools, and models. The authors summarize the FDA regulation of tobacco products and provide ten examples of ongoing work in communication regulatory science, specifically relating to tobacco control. They conclude that communication regulatory science in the realm of tobacco control could have an instrumental impact on the tobacco epidemic and population health by helping public health researchers implement effective communication to prevent tobacco initiation and increase cessation in at-risk populations.

They used data from the 2015 National  Health Interview Survey-Cancer Control Supplement to determine who is most at  risk for sunburn and by extension, skin cancer. The researchers found that  independent of race or ethnicity, sun sensitivity was significantly associated  with a higher sunburn prevalence. They also found that sun-avoidance  practices were associated with lower sunburn risk. People who engaged in  sunless tanning, aerobic activity, binge drinking, and who were overweight or obese  were more likely to experience sunburn compared to respective comparison  groups. The results suggest that  public health practitioners and others need to consider sun sensitivity rather  than just ethnic group when targeting certain demographic groups for sun-safety  interventions, and that people engaging in certain activities may need  additional interventions to address sun-safety challenges.</p>

        <p>NIH  will host an <a href="https://www.scgcorp.com/SocialDeterminants18/">all-day meeting on  screening and referral for social determinants</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="Exit disclaimer"></a> on May 3 on the NIH  campus in Bethesda, MD. Social and behavioral measures are now routinely  collected in many electronic health records (EHR) systems and are increasingly  used in clinical care and population health assessment. Routine  screening for a patient&rsquo;s unmet social needs and adverse health behaviors,  combined with referral to precision interventions to reduce the patient&rsquo;s  health risks associated with these &ldquo;social determinants,&rdquo; is an emerging trend  in health care. This one-day meeting will highlight recent innovative  applications and ongoing research. It will also facilitate dialogue about  future research directions between scientific researchers in the field and  staff from NIH and other federal agencies . This meeting will not be live  webcast.
