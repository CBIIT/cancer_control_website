<div style="float:left; width:100px; border:thin solid #ccc; margin:10px; padding:5px; font-size:9px;"><img src="images/Susan-Czajkowski.jpg" alt="Susan Czajkowski" width="95" height="144" align="left" /></div>
<p>Dr.  Susan Czajkowski has been appointed Chief of the Health Behaviors Research Branch  (HBRB) within the NCI Behavioral Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. HBRB supports research on cancer prevention and control  in areas including diet, energy balance, physical activity, sleep, sun safety,  protection from viral exposure, and genetic influences on behaviors. Dr.  Czajkowski&rsquo;s expertise in health behavior interventions as well as psychosocial  aspects of disease and health-related quality of life will help guide the  research agenda in HBRB and inform new initiatives in the Behavioral Research  Program, led by Associate Director, Dr. William Klein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Czajkowski&rsquo;s exceptional track record in  collaboration and innovation of behavioral and social science research is an  incredibly valuable addition to NCI,&rdquo; noted Dr. Klein. &ldquo;Her scientific  leadership experiences and expertise make her an ideal Branch Chief and member  of our program leadership team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Czajkowski first joined the National Institutes  of Health in 1987 when she became a Project Officer in the Behavioral Medicine  Research Group at the <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/">National Heart, Lung,  and Blood Institute</a> (NHLBI). Since that time, she has become an expert in  the role of social and psychological factors in disease risk and recovery. She most  recently served as a Program Director for the Clinical Applications and  Prevention Branch at NHLBI. In that role she has developed and led initiatives  on the effects of depression treatment on cardiovascular disease outcomes, the improvement  of adherence to lifestyle and medical therapies, and the translation of basic  behavioral science findings into health-related behavioral interventions.</p>
<p>Her interest in early-phase translational  behavioral science prompted her to initiate and serve as lead Project Officer  for the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) consortium, a  trans-NIH network of seven projects aimed at developing innovative behavioral  interventions to reduce obesity using findings from basic research on human  behavior. A major product of the ORBIT consortium has been the development of  the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642841">ORBIT Model</a>, a systematic framework for developing behavioral  treatments for preventing and treating chronic diseases, which was recently published in <em>Health Psychology</em>.  Other recent collaborations include participation in <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange/index">the Science of Behavior  Change Initiative</a>, the <a href="http://oppnet.nih.gov/">Basic Behavioral  and Social Sciences Research Opportunity Network</a> (OppNet), and the <a href="https://obssr.od.nih.gov/index.aspx">Office of Behavioral and Social  Sciences Research</a> coordinating committee. She received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree  from <a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> and a master&rsquo;s and doctorate in psychology from  the <a href="http://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland, College Park</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a></p>

<p>  Dr. Robert Croyle, DCCPS director, said, &ldquo;Dr. Helzlsouer is a  highly accomplished epidemiologist and clinician with a broad vision of cancer  epidemiology, prevention, and control. She brings a valuable blend of medical,  scientific, and leadership skills, which will be a strong asset for NCI and  DCCPS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr.  Helzlsouer is board certified in medical oncology. Prior to joining NCI, she  was a professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins  Bloomberg School of Public Health and, since 2004, she directed <a href="https://mdmercy.com/centers-of-excellence/additional-centers/prevention-and-research-center">The  Prevention &amp; Research Center</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>, which she established at Mercy Medical Center in  Baltimore.

<h3>Breaking up sedentary behavior improves metabolic function in children</h3>
<p>  A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26312582">study</a> led by former NCI fellow Britni Belcher and Dr. David  Berrigan of the <a href="/brp/hbrb/">Health Behaviors Research Branch</a> and Dr. Jack A. Yanovski (PI) of the <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development</a> found that interrupting sedentary behavior in children  improved their metabolic function. The study, &ldquo;Effects of Interrupting  Children&rsquo;s Sedentary Behaviors with Activity on Metabolic Function: A  Randomized Trial,&rdquo; was published in the <em><a href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/10.1210/jc.2015-2803">Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and  Metabolism</a></em><a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>. Children  of normal weight between 7 to 11 years old participated in two experimental,  randomly assigned conditions on different days: 3 hours of continuous sitting or 3 hours of  sitting broken up by 3 minutes of moderate-intensity walking every 30 minutes.  Children were given a buffet meal after each condition. The researchers  measured insulin, C-peptide, glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides, and cortisol every 30 minutes. They found that interrupted sitting resulted in  significantly lower levels of insulin and free fatty acid concentrations.  C-peptide and glucose levels were also lower in the group with interrupted  sitting. In addition, the children who had just walked did not eat  significantly more than the children in the sitting group. Interrupting  sedentary behavior in children may be a strategy to improve metabolic health.</p>

<h3>Retraining the brain with cognitive  exercises, electric currents </h3>

The goal of the study was to understand why it is  so difficult for people to quit smoking, which she believes, is not the result  of a lack of knowledge or motivation. Cravings are powerful. There is also  evidence that activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the area  responsible for self-control and planning, weakens when people experience  nicotine withdrawal, she said. So she studied how to help people &ldquo;retrain&rdquo;  their brains by stimulation in order to improve cognitive performance with the  goal positive behavior change.</p>

<h3>Exploring the link between e-cigarettes  and traditional cigarettes</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/09/08/study-teens-using-e-cigs-much-more-likely-to-start-smoking-cigarettes/">The Washington Post</a></em> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> recently  covered another <a href="/brp/tcrb/">Tobacco Control Research Branch</a>-funded  study in its To Your Health section. The study was titled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26348249">Progression to Traditional Cigarette Smoking After Electronic  Cigarette Use Among U.S. Adolescents and Young Adults</a>,&rdquo; and was  published online in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.  The article will appear in print in November. The lead author on the study was <a href="http://www.dom.pitt.edu/dgim/faculty_info.aspx?fp=4945">Dr. Brian Primack</a>  <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a>, an  assistant vice chancellor for research on health and society at the University  of Pittsburgh. The researchers conducted analyses of  longitudinal cohort data from 694 nonsmokers between the ages of 16 and 26 from  the U.S.-based Dartmouth Media, Advertising and Health Study. At one-year  follow-up, 37.5 percent of those who had initially reported using e-cigarettes  had progressed to using conventional cigarettes, compared to 9.6 percent who  had not used e-cigarettes at baseline. In an analysis that took into account  demographics and other variables related to smoking, baseline e-cigarette use  was a significant predictor of smoking at follow-up. The researchers concluded  that e-cigarettes are associated with progression to conventional smoking. </p>

<h3>Beta-blockers and survival for  patients with ovarian cancer</h3>
<div style="float:left; width:200px; margin:5px; padding:5px; clear:left"><img src="../bbpsb/images/ntwk_biopthwys.jpg" width="200" height="60" alt="National Cancer Institute - Network on Biobehavioral Pathways in Cancer" /></div><p>A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Clinical+impact+of+selective+and+nonselective+beta-blockers+on+survival+in+patients+with+ovarian+cancer">paper</a> published this month in the journal <em>Cancer</em> shows an association between the use of nonselective beta-blockers and longer  overall ovarian cancer survival. The article, titled &ldquo;Clinical impact of  selective and nonselective beta-blockers on survival in patients with ovarian  cancer,&rdquo; followed 1,425 women with ovarian cancer. The women who took any type  of beta-blocker had a median overall survival of 47.8 months, compared to 42  months for nonusers. The researchers also found that beta-blocker type  mattered. Women on nonselective beta-blockers had a median overall survival of  94.9 months, compared to 38 months for women on selective agents. Portions of  the study were supported by the <a href="/brp/bbpsb/">Basic Biobehavioral and  Psychological Sciences Branch</a> (BBPSB).

In the Q &amp; A, Dr. Willis reflected on his 25  years in questionnaire design, cognitive interviewing, and survey pretesting.  He told the association his career in survey methodology was largely unplanned.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that much of life is unplanned and unintended­—and when the  football bounces to you, pick it up, because you&rsquo;re now a running back,&rdquo; he  said. He credited his success to strong mentors and collaborations over the  years. He&rsquo;s found the NIH to be a model for &ldquo;how the federal government can work  effectively on behalf of its citizenry,&rdquo; he said. Dr. Willis encourages current  and future survey methodologists to be open to new opportunities in technology and  the changing landscape of survey methodology. </p>

<p>Did you know about the proposed changes to the Common Rule for the Protection  of Human Subjects?</p>
<ul style="padding-left:2em;">
  <li>Some       studies that currently require IRB review would now become exempt. These       include:
  <ul style="padding-left:2em;">
    <li>Surveys</li>
    <li>Certain        research involving benign interventions with adults</li>
    <li>Secondary        research use of identifiable private information originally collected as        part of non-research activity, where notice of such possible use was        given</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Some       studies that are currently exempt would be excluded from the Common Rule. This       includes research that is inherently low-risk.</li>
  <li>Investigators       may use a forthcoming web-based decision tool to determine exempt status       (and will not need administrative or IRB review to determine exempt       status).</li>
  <li>Secondary       research use of biospecimens will require informed consent (e.g., broad       consent for future, unspecified use), even if the investigator is not       being given information that would enable him or her to identify whose       biospecimen it is.</li>
  <li>IRB       continuing review will no longer be required for studies that undergo       expedited review or have completed interventions and are merely analyzing       data or involve only observational follow-up in conjunction with standard       clinical care.</li>

The video  highlights which racial/ethnic groups are most at risk for certain cancers. For  example, black people have the highest rate of colorectal cancer, Asians have  the highest rate of liver cancer, and Hispanic women have the highest rate of  cervical cancer. Health disparities are an area of research emphasis for  behavioral research because they occur due to barriers to screening and care  and for a variety of psychosocial factors.
