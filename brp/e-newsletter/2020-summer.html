            <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
            <p>The recent unconscionable deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and the many others who preceded them, have highlighted a lasting stain on our country&rsquo;s history. As a scientific community, we need to stand together with an ethos of anti-racism, mutual respect, humility, and kindness. I&rsquo;ve been impressed by the outpouring of support for change from individuals and organizations across the map. I hope these messages provide some solace to members of our community whose own personal experiences resonate with these horrific events, and motivation for all of us to aim for a better future. Moreover, given that disparities continue to plague cancer prevention and cancer care, I hope you will continue to generate new ideas in your research programs that tackle cancer morbidity and mortality in ways that also acknowledge and address the nefarious effects of structural racism.  </p>
            <p>Since we began our COVID-19 journey several months ago, not a day goes by without my appreciation for the tremendous dedication and persistence of our research community to understand this virus and its far-reaching implications on our communities, our cancer patients, and the world as we know it. I feel fortunate to work in an organization that is helping to advance COVID-related science in myriad areas, from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launch-public-private-partnership-speed-covid-19-vaccine-treatment-options">Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership</a> to <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/covid-19-nci-antibody-testing-review?cid=eb_govdel">independent testing and validation of antibody tests at the NCI Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR)</a>. Yet, I&rsquo;m acutely aware of the unique family and work challenges that our community faces as we navigate this difficult and unpredictable course. I hope you are receiving the necessary support from our staff to continue your research. </p>
            <p>We begin this issue with COVID-related information, funding opportunities, and resources. Instead of duplicating information you likely are already receiving from other sources, we encourage you to bookmark two NIH and NCI websites dedicated to researchers. We do, however, highlight specific resources such as the <a href="#covid-tool">COVID-19 Portfolio Tool</a> and the <a href="#covid-survey">Survey Items available through PhenX</a>.</p>
            <p>In this issue you&rsquo;ll also find new <a href="#Funding">funding opportunities</a> and <a href="#nosis">notices of special interest (NOSIs)</a> related to multiple morbidities and the link between alcohol and cancer, among others. Additionally, tobacco control researchers will be excited to have access to newly released 2018–2019 data from the <a href="#tus-cps">Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS)</a> that include new topics such as workplace and home vaping restrictions, e-cigarette price, and prevalence of heated tobacco product use. Other recently updated resources include the <a href="#report">Cancer Trends Progress Report</a>, the <a href="#annual">Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer</a>, and the SEER Cancer Statistics Review (CSR), 1975–2017.</p>
            <p>Finally, we are pleased to welcome <a href="#staff">new staff</a> to our program, as well as say farewell to others who are transitioning to other areas in NCI. </p>
            <p>As a reminder, you&rsquo;re free to <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brpsubscribe">manage your BRP newsletter subscription</a> at any time, but we hope you find the information beneficial.

        <p id="Implementation"><strong>Implementation of a statewide hotline system in response to COVID-19</strong></p>
        <p>A recent paper led by BRP grantee Dr. Jennifer DeVoe describes the challenges primary care practices are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need for collaboration between academic health centers and state and local public health agencies to alleviate the burden on the primary health care system. Oregon Health &amp; Science University has partnered in this way to implement the centralized COVID-19 Connected Care Center. The three-phase implementation approach includes a statewide hotline that was made available to established Oregon Health &amp; Science University patients, allowing for immediate nursing assessment and facilitation of primary care telemedicine visits (Phase I). Phases II and III involve expanding the hotline format to primary care practices throughout the state and, eventually, to the 25% of Oregonians without primary care access and to patients of small practices that lack the resources of larger health care systems. BRP grantee Dr. Alex Krist is also a co-author on the paper.</p>

        <p id="snacks"><strong>Strong snack laws associated with higher vegetable consumption among high school students</strong></p>
        <p>A recent paper led by BRP grantee Dr. Jamie Chriqui examined the association between state snack laws and high school student fruit and vegetable consumption pre- and post-federal Smart Snacks standards (effective school year 2014–2015). Researchers used 2004–2016 data from NCI&rsquo;s <a href="https://class.cancer.gov/">Classification of Laws Associated with School Students</a> (CLASS) and 2005–2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey data. This study provides evidence that students in states with strong snack laws had higher odds of consuming vegetables—salad, in particular—compared to students in states with no laws. Findings show the important role that standards restricting the availability of junk foods in schools play on increasing student vegetable consumption. Additionally, the findings illustrate how federal standards harmonized the patchwork of state laws that existed prior to Smart Snacks and the important role of consistent national standards in supporting student vegetable consumption. BRP Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=51678&name=Frank-Perna&bioType=stf">Dr. Frank Perna</a> was a co-author on the paper. </p>

        <p>A research team including BRP grantee Dr. Lee Jones conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the tolerability and efficacy of two exercise training dose regimens on cardiorespiratory fitness and patient-reported outcomes in patients with posttreatment primary breast cancer. The main outcome was change in peak oxygen consumption from baseline to after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes, tolerability, and safety. Their findings indicate that short-term exercise training, independently of dosing schedule, is associated with modest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness in patients previously treated for early-stage breast cancer.</p>

        <p>A recent paper led by Dr. Jim Sallis features the IPEN (International Physical Activity and Environment Network) Adult Study, which was conducted to provide international evidence on associations of built environments with physical activity and weight status in twelve countries on five continents. The research team reanalyzed data from eight primary papers to identify patterns of findings across studies. Their findings indicate that neighborhood environment attributes (objectively measured and self-reported) were strongly related to all physical activity outcomes (accelerometer-assessed total physical activity, reported walking for transport and leisure) and meaningfully related to overweight/obesity. Overall, findings provide evidence in support of global initiatives to increase physical activity and control noncommunicable diseases while achieving sustainable development goals.

        <p>BRP Associate Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=480126&name=William%20-Klein&bioType=stf">Dr. William Klein</a> and BRP Program Directors <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439021&name=Rebecca-Ferrer&bioType=stf">Dr. Rebecca Ferrer</a> and <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1462212&name=Annette-Kaufman&bioType=stf">Dr. Annette Kaufman</a> recently published a commentary that discusses how people reflect on their cancer risk and the implications for clinical oncology. The assumption that people actually &ldquo;think&rdquo; about risk is not fully supported by decision science research. Instead, individuals&rsquo; risk perceptions may be influenced by social factors, along with emotional and motivational factors. Implications for clinical oncology include acknowledging that patients and the general population&rsquo;s understanding and reaction to risk are rooted in emotion, intuition, social comparisons, and social identities, potentially reflecting an adaptive orientation toward risk. In turn, recipients of risk messages may be particularly responsive to practices and interventions that highlight social comparisons and social identities, quell defensiveness, and acknowledge negative emotions.</p>

        <p id="Assessing"><strong>Assessing simulated cancer prevention Facebook messages using eye-tracking</strong></p>
        <p>In a recent paper, researchers conducted a mixed-methods experimental study that used eye-tracking technology to examine social media users&rsquo; attention to simulated cancer prevention Facebook posts. Stimuli conditions included message format (narrative/non-narrative), information veracity, source (organization/individual), and cancer topic (HPV vaccine and sunscreen safety). Overall, users spent significantly more time on posts attributed to individuals and on narrative-based posts. Additionally, users spent approximately equal amounts of time focusing on the source of the message as the content. There were no significant differences in the amount of time spent on the other message components by condition. The paper was led by BRP Program Director <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=993308&name=Wen-Ying%20Sylvia-Chou&bioType=stf">Dr. Sylvia Chou</a>, and co-authors included current and former BRP fellows and collaborators.</p>

        <p>A research team including BRP grantees Dr. Vanessa Sheppard and Dr. Alejandra Hurtado-de-Mendoza conducted a qualitative study and interviewed 20 Latinas (10 affected, 10 unaffected) at increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. They asked participants about their knowledge and perceptions of genetic cancer risk assessment, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, risk, benefits, motivators, barriers, challenges, and experiences with genetic cancer risk assessment. Findings identified multiple barriers and facilitators to genetic cancer risk assessment uptake in this population, including patient-level psychosocial/cultural factors (e.g., limited knowledge, worry about relatives' risk) and health care system factors (e.g., receiving no referrals). Additionally, there were notable differences in awareness and knowledge between affected and unaffected women (e.g., genetic testing awareness), as well as knowledge gaps that were evident in both groups (e.g., age of diagnosis as a risk factor). </p>

        <p>BRP fellow <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=31160387&name=Camella-Rising&bioType=flw">Dr. Camella Rising</a> led a paper that used NCI <a href="https://hints.cancer.gov/">Health Information National Trends Survey</a> (HINTS) data to examine patterns of mobile health (mHealth) technology use for health and behavioral tracking among 6,789 US adults. They characterized respondents into five patterns of mHealth use on a spectrum from mHealth nonowners and nonusers to supertrackers who track health or behaviors and goals using a smartphone or tablet plus other devices. Researchers found distinctive sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of the population by pattern of mHealth use, with noticeable differences between individuals who do and do not use devices to track goals. Several characteristics of individuals who track health or behaviors but not goals (device trackers) are similar to those of mHealth nonowners and nonusers. Results indicate that compared with supertrackers, device trackers have higher odds of being male, are older in age, have an annual household income of US $20,000 to US $49,999, and have a chronic health condition. Device trackers also have higher odds of not being health information seekers than supertrackers.
