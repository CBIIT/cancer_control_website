		    <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
			<img src="/brp/images/OAD-Staff/klein-william200x300.jpg" alt="William Klein" class="pull-right">
		    <p>2020 is shaping up to be a busy and exciting year for BRP. As you may well be aware, <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget">NCI's FY2020 paylines for almost all NIH grant mechanisms have increased since FY2019</a>, allowing us to fund even more grants than before. In this issue you&rsquo;ll find many new funding opportunities, reissuances, and notices of special interest (NOSI), a new type of announcement that enables NCI (and NIH) to delineate research priorities in specific scientific areas. We highlight recent NOSIs in a variety of areas including, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, sexual and gender minority populations, geospatial approaches to cancer control, and dissemination and implementation science. Follow <a href="#filter">the tip below</a> to find NOSIs more easily in the NIH Guide, thanks to improved search filters. </p>
			<p>This year also marks many new updates to BRP resources. For tobacco control researchers, you can now access the July 2018 data from the 2018-2019 <a href="#tus-cps">Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS)</a>. We also recently released data from the <a href="#hints">Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, Cycle 3</a> which includes new data on UV exposure, dietary intake, alcohol consumption, e-cigarette use, and more. And make sure to check our newly refreshed <a href="#class">Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (CLASS) website</a>. The website offers enhanced interactive maps and tables to easily view physical education and nutrition policies across the U.S. You&rsquo;ll find all these resources and more neatly packaged in the <a href="#overview">2019 DCCPS Overview and Highlights document</a>, an annual publication that this year showcases behavioral research.</p>
			<p>Below we highlight findings from BRP-supported or BRP-funded projects in the journals and in the media. For example, read about the effectiveness of the <a href="#exposure">court-ordered tobacco-related corrective statements</a> in reaching the public, how exercise prescriptions can <a href="#prescriptions">improve cancer survivorship</a>, and how the <a href="#aging">brain ages following chemotherapy in breast cancer survivors</a>. </p>
			<p>Lastly, we&rsquo;re moving into a busy conference season, with many BRP staff attending key meetings such as the <a href="#mar11">Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT)</a>, the <a href="#apr14">Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM)</a>, and the <a href="#mar2224">American Society of Preventive Oncology</a>.</p>
			<p>In order to keep our scientific community up-to-date on our resources and funding opportunities, we&rsquo;ve added recent grant applicants to our BRP Scientific News listserv. You&rsquo;re free to <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brpsubscribe">manage your subscription</a> at any time, &nbsp;but we hope you find the information beneficial. If you&rsquo;re on social media, follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/ncibehaviors?lang=en">@NCIBehaviors</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img alt="exit disclaimer" src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png"></a></p>
			<p>We know that the spread of COVD-19 has produced a period of uncertainty that may influence travel to conferences and many other decisions. On behalf of BRP, we hope that the impact on you and your families is minimal. If you are concerned about the impact of the virus on your funded research project, please be in touch with your Program Director.</p>

		<p id="both"><strong>Both in-person and online training models show promise for scaling up an evidence-based nutrition and physical activity intervention </strong></p>
		<p> A recent paper by BRP grantee Dr. Rebekka Lee and colleagues conducted a three-arm group-randomized implementation study that compared the effectiveness of in-person and online training models for scaling up an evidence-based nutrition and physical activity intervention compared to controls. Findings from the pilot trial suggest that the in-person training model was an effective approach, whereas the less expensive online training approach could be beneficial for geographically disbursed sites where in-person training is less feasible. </p>

		<p id="obesity"><strong>Higher obesity associated with poorer health outcomes among endometrial cancer survivors</strong></p>
		<p> A recent paper by BRP grantee Dr. Nora Nock and collaborators investigated if varying levels of obesity are differentially associated with sleep, depression, and quality of life among endometrial cancer survivors. Results indicate that 72% of survivors had poor sleep quality and 71% reported sleeping &lt;7 hours per night. Additionally, they found that endometrial cancer survivors with class III obesity had poorer sleep quality, higher depression, and lower quality of life compared to those with class I obesity. Future interventions are needed to address both obesity and poor sleep.</p>

		<p id="physical"><strong>State physical education laws associated with greater physical activity in high school students</strong></p>
		<p> A recent paper led by Dr. Wanting Lin investigated the association between state physical education (PE) time requirements and physical activity (PA) and PE outcomes among high school students. The authors included a combination of BRP staff and extramural researchers. Their study found that strong PE time requirement laws (i.e., &ge;90 minutes/week) were associated with greater overall weekly PA among students and a reduced probability of not engaging in activity. These associations were attributed to reduced probabilities of no days of moderate or vigorous exercise and by increased daily engagement in vigorous exercise and moderate exercise. PE time requirement laws were also associated with increased time spent in PE exercising or playing sports. Overall, these findings may inform the development of policy around the potential effectiveness of strong PE time requirement laws in increasing PA and PE. </p>

		<p id="symptom"><strong>Greater symptom burden among older breast cancer survivors than older adults without cancer</strong></p>
		<p>A study of the effects of symptom burden on well-being among older breast cancer survivors was published in the December 2019 issue of <em>Cancer.</em> The paper was led by BRP grantee Dr. Jeanne Mandelblatt and co-authors included multiple extramural researchers. Symptom burden was measured as the sum of self-reported pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, neuropathy, sleep disturbance, cardiac problems, and cognitive dysfunction. The study concluded that cancer and its treatment were associated with greater actionable symptoms and loss of well-being compared to non-cancer populations. These findings suggest the need for surveillance and intervention.</p>

		<p id="aging"><strong>Brain aging following chemotherapy among breast cancer patients</strong></p>
		<p> A paper led by Dr. Ashley Henneghan investigated brain aging in newly diagnosed, middle-aged breast cancer patients who were treated with chemotherapy and compared changes in brain aging over time with that of comparable healthy controls. Co-authors included multiple extramural researchers. Overall, this study&rsquo;s results indicate that there was increased cortical brain aging in breast cancer patients after receiving chemotherapy treatment, and this aging was associated with decreased verbal memory performance. </p>

		<p id="cigarette"><strong>Higher cigarette taxes associated with lower sales volume of smokeless tobacco</strong></p>
		<p>A recent paper led by Dr. Mary Hrywna looked at how tobacco control policies and retail promotion may influence smokeless tobacco sales in convenience stores across 30 regions of the U.S. from 2005 to 2010. Co-authors included an extramural researcher. Researchers found higher cigarette tax was related to lower sales volume of smokeless tobacco. Overall, results suggest some individuals substituted cigarettes for smokeless tobacco products, whereas others used smokeless tobacco products in conjunction with cigarettes.</p>

		<p id="comprehensive"><strong>Study of a comprehensive tobacco treatment program&rsquo;s effectiveness in patients with and without cancer</strong></p>
		<p> BRP grantee Dr. Paul Cinciripini and colleagues assessed the outcomes of a tobacco treatment program in patients with and without cancer (N=3,245) while examining differences associated with the patients&rsquo; cancer history and cancer site. The program included a medical consultation, 6-8 counseling sessions, and 10-12 weeks of pharmacotherapy. Rates of 7-day smoking abstinence did not vary significantly among patients with or without cancer at 9-months post-intervention. Patients with head and neck cancer were more likely to abstain from smoking than those diagnosed with cancer at other sites. As the authors explain, these results suggest that treating tobacco dependence in the oncology setting can result in sustained abstinence among cancer patients at rates similar to those without cancer. </p>

		<p id="JUUL"><strong>Mango and mint are JUUL flavor preferences among U.S. students</strong><br>
		 BRP grantee Dr. Adam Leventhal and colleagues examined young people&rsquo;s JUUL flavor preferences in a nationally representative sample of 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students who participated in the 2019 <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/monitoring-future">Monitoring the Future study</a>. In this study, 12.6% of students were current (past 30-day) users of JUUL e-cigarette. Among JUUL users with flavor preference data, mango was the most commonly used flavor among 8th grade users (33.5%), followed by mint (29.2%). Mint was the most commonly used flavor among 10th grade (43.5%) and 12th grade JUUL users (47.1%). Preference for tobacco-related flavors in all grades was less than 2.0%. The authors comment that, &ldquo;The current findings raise uncertainty whether regulations or sales suspensions that exempt mint flavors are optimal strategies for reducing youth e-cigarette use.&rdquo;</p>

Co-authors included BRP staff. The statements were ordered by a Federal court following a racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies. Overall, less than half (40.6%) of the sample recalled exposure to any corrective statement in the first 6 months of their implementation. Current smokers were more likely to report seeing these statements than nonsmokers, and those with no more than a high school education were less likely to report exposure than those with a college degree. Statements relating to the health effects of tobacco use were the most commonly recalled topic (34.7%). As the corrective statements did not reach nearly half of the adult population, the authors posit that more targeted health communication efforts may help to increase the overall prevalence of exposure to these important, court-ordered messages.</p>

		<p>NCI recently conducted an analysis of NCI-funded grants and found that the level of effort proposed in grant applications varied significantly. The National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) and NCI leadership have determined that a minimum level of effort is necessary for certain types of grants to ensure that the PIs of a proposed study are engaged. The proposed changes were discussed at the <a href="https://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?live=35642&bhcp=1">February 11 NCAB meeting</a>. Unless otherwise stated in an FOA, the minimum effort policy would apply to the following types of grants: U01, R01 (including multi-PI), R21, and P01. <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/nci-bottom-line-blog/2020/nci-grant-effort-policy-changes?cid=eb_govdel">Read this NCI Bottom Line blog post for additional information »</a>. </p>
