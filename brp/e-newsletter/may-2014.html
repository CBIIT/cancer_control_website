 Associate Director, BRP </div>
<p>As Associate Director of the BRP within the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), I am pleased to present the first issue of BRP Scientific News. This e-newsletter will highlight extramural scientific advances and provide information about training opportunities, research tools, initiatives, and events sponsored by the program. We hope that you enjoy reading this issue and find it useful in advancing your own research. The need for rigorous basic and applied research in the behavioral and social sciences in a health context has never been greater, and we appreciate your important role in advancing these efforts.</p>
<p> BRP initiates, supports, and evaluates a comprehensive program of research ranging from basic behavioral research to the development, testing, and dissemination of interventions in areas such as tobacco use, screening, dietary behavior, and sun protection. <a href="/brp/about.html">Read more about BRP</a>. After a long-range evaluation of the research portfolio and strategic plan, BRP was reorganized in 2012. More information about the reorganization can be found in the <a href="http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2012/09/behavioral-research.aspx">American Psychological Association&rsquo;s September 2012 issue of <em>Psychological Science Agenda</em></a>. Earlier this year, BRP leadership published a manuscript in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512871">American Journal of Preventive Medicine, &ldquo;Behavioral Research in Cancer Prevention and Control: A Look to the Future.&rdquo;</a> In the paper, we highlight important opportunities in behavioral research and consider contemporary avenues of application for cancer control at several levels of the cancer continuum. </p>
<p> Our aim is to reinforce our commitment to open channels of communication with the research community. If you wish to continue receiving&nbsp;<em>BRP Scientific News</em>, please be sure to place this email address in your address book to ensure proper delivery.

<h2 id="funding">Funding Opportunities </h2>
<p>A full list of current BRP <a href="/brp/funding/index.html">Funding Opportunity Announcements</a> can be found online. This list highlights some ongoing research initiatives relevant to behavioral medicine at NIH. </p>
<p>The <a href="/brp/bbpsb/ncintwk-biopthwys.html">National Cancer Institute Network on Biobehavioral Pathways in Cancer</a> has just closed its first Request for Proposals (RFP), Issued by Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. (<a href="/brp/bbpsb/docs/Leidos_Biomedical_Research_Inc_RFP_No_S14_075.pdf" target="_blank">S14-075</a>). The RFP collected novel small scale pilot project proposals to advance the knowledge of molecular pathways that link psychological, behavioral, or social factors to cancer biology. These projects will inform further research opportunities to develop effective interventions and improve clinical outcomes. </p>
<p>Letters of Intent to apply for the Funding Announcement, <em>Fundamental Mechanisms of Affective and Decisional Processes in Cancer Control </em>(<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-14-067.html">PAR-14-067</a>) will be accepted beginning in May 2014. This initiative will support research to generate new fundamental knowledge of affective processes. Successful basic affective science projects must have downstream consequences for single and multiple event decisions and behaviors in cancer prevention and control. However, projects do not necessarily need to examine these decisions and behaviors directly, as long as future cancer implications are clearly defined.</p>
<p>Scientists within disciplines not traditionally focused on cancer research are encouraged to apply. Such disciplines might include, but are not limited to affective and cognitive science, decision science, consumer science, and neuroscience. For inquiries on this funding announcement, please contact <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439021&amp;bioType=stf">Rebecca Ferrer</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to joining NCI, Dr. Alfano was a faculty member at The Ohio State University (OSU) College of Public Health, the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research.&nbsp;Her research interests focused on interventions to promote physical activity in cancer survivors and the interrelationships between physical activity, energy balance, and biological mechanisms underlying risk for chronic and late effects of cancer treatment as well as prognosis.</p>
<h2 id="pursuit">The pursuit of happiness</h2>
<p>In an article published in <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.14225!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/503458a.pdf" target="_blank">Nature</a></em>, <a href="https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45359">Dr. Steve Cole</a>, a founding member of the <a href="/brp/bbpsb/ncintwk-biopthwys.html">National Cancer Institute Network on Biobehavioral Pathways in Cancer</a>, discusses his programs of research to analyze molecular pathways by which social and environmental factors influence health. Dr. Cole has published several studies suggesting a correlation between negative mood (such as loneliness or stress) and our body&rsquo;s gene expression. His connections suggest that mood can influence an array of illnesses, from diabetes to HIV and cancer. Dr. Cole&rsquo;s first <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r189" target="_blank">investigation (PDF)</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img alt="exit disclaimer" src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png"></a> focused on loneliness, a known psychological risk factor. He examined the whole genome of chronically lonely people, and compared it to that of people who reported having strong social support. Dr. Cole discovered that 209 of the 22,000 genes in the human genome differed between the two groups. Interestingly, of the genes that were up-regulated among lonely people, most were implicated in the inflammatory response. Now, Dr. Cole has moved into the realm of happiness with the help of collaborator Dr. <a href="http://fredrickson.socialpsychology.org/">Barbara Frederickson</a>. Studying well-being is particularly difficult because, unlike stress, there are no biological markers to help quantify it. Recently, Drs. Cole and Frederickson have tried to distinguish between two types of happiness: hedonic well-being (characterized by material pleasures), and eudaimonic well-being (deeper satisfaction resulting from a feeling of purpose). They discovered that there are actual gene expression differences between the two types; those reporting higher levels of eudaimonic well-being had gene expression profiles similar to those who reported having strong social support. On the contrary, hedonic well-being was associated with gene expression profiles of people with negative mood-states or of those lacking social support. Dr. Cole hypothesizes that the pattern he has observed has to do with stress. That is to say, those who are driven by eudaimonic well-being (meaning, they feel happiness due to connections beyond themselves, such as community involvement, social relationships, or intellectual pursuits) are better able to deal with stressful situations.</p>

<h2 id="divulging">Divulging DNA secrets of dead stirs debate</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/petersen-gloria-m-ph-d/bio-00027781">Gloria Petersen</a> of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, whose work is supported by the <a href="/brp/hcirb/index.html">Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch</a> in <a href="/index.html">DCCPS</a>, is among the first to examine how to return genetic information to relatives of a deceased research participant.</p>
<p>In the United States, when a person dies, doctors may advise the dissemination of relevant news to relatives. However, the law is less clear in situations with study volunteers, where scientists do not have the same obligations as physicians do with their patients. Recently, with funding from <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/">NCI</a>, Petersen has surveyed 3,000 people with pancreatic cancer and their families, as well as 3,000 control participants to determine opinion about posthumous privacy and information-sharing in various scenarios. Although relatives almost always feel that the researcher is obligated to report useful information (such as a BRCA2 mutation), sharing information can conflict with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as well as state privacy laws, depending to whom the information is disclosed to. Petersen and her colleagues plan to draft guidance on returning genetic results to relatives, due out this fall.</p>

<h2 id="yoga">Yoga&rsquo;s impact on inflammation, mood, and fatigue in breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial</h2>
<p>In a <a href="http://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/JCO.2013.51.8860?sid=99ea39b5-96a2-4e6d-b655-018c2181bd66">study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and funded by the <a href="/brp/bbpsb/index.html">Basic Biobehavioral and Psychological Sciences Branch</a> of the <a href="/brp/index.html">BRP</a>, <a href="http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/1/kiecolt-glaser/">Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser</a> and her colleagues investigated the effects of yoga on inflammation, mood, and fatigue in breast cancer survivors. A three-month trial was conducted with breast cancer survivors either assigned to 12 weeks of 90-minute hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. Results showed that the yoga group had higher post-treatment vitality and lower fatigue. The study also found that certain pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with negative health outcomes were lower among those who participated in yoga. The authors suggest that the persistent fatigue felt among cancer survivors is related to heightened inflammation levels. They also suggest that the results of the present study could be applied to other people who suffer from issues related to fatigue and inflammation.<br />

<h2 id="understanding">Understanding &lsquo;chemobrain&rsquo;</h2>
<p>In a piece published in the <em><a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/understanding-chemobrain">APS Observer</a></em>, <a href="/brp/">BRP</a> members <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=3501713&amp;bioType=stf">Jerry Suls</a>, <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1618">Wendy Nelson</a>, and Lynne Padgett discuss the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction resulting from standard-dose chemotherapy cancer treatment. </p>
<p>The experience of “chemobrain” refers to the diffuse mental slowing and fogginess thought to result from the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy. These cognitive changes can occur at any point during or following chemotherapy and may persist for months or years. Although the cancer survivor community has been aware of chemobrain for some time, it is only recently that clinicians and researchers have attempted to study this phenomenon more systematically. Part of the problem in studying chemobrain is that the experience is different for each patient. In addition, standard neuropsychological tests may not be sensitive enough to detect the often subtle cognitive changes that accompany chemotherapy and cancer treatment. To date, most of the research on chemobrain has been the province of neuropsychologists and oncologists. A multidisciplinary approach involving, for example, cognitive scientists, aging researchers, and dementia researchers, is needed to broaden our understanding of chemobrain.</p>

<h2 id="ecigarettes">Young using e-cigarettes; smoke too</h2>
<p>In an article funded by the <a href="/brp/tcrb/index.html">Tobacco Control Research Branch</a> of the <a href="/brp/">BRP</a> and published in <em><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1840772">JAMA Pediatrics</a></em>, <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stanton.glantz">Dr. Stanton Glantz</a>, the American Legacy Foundation Distinguished Professor of Tobacco Control and director for the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, explores the prevalence of cigarette smoking among youth who also utilize electronic cigarette  (e-cigarette) devices. </p>
<p>E-cigarettes are devices that deliver nicotine, but contain lower levels of toxins than regular cigarettes. E-cigarette use has doubled among youths in grades 6 through 12 between 2011 and 2012, going from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent. The present research study found that among middle and high school students, those who used e-cigarettes were more likely to be real cigarette smokers, and also less likely to quit than students who did not use the electronic devices. Additionally, the study found that e-cigarette users are more likely to be heavy smokers. According to Dr. Glantz, the use of e-cigarettes among U.S. adolescents appears to be encouraging cigarette use, as opposed to curbing it or leading to quitting. However, in an article published in <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/health/young-users-of-e-cigarettes-less-likely-to-quit-smoking-study-finds.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a>,</em> other researchers have challenged that notion, arguing that the correlation between youths who smoke and have a harder time quitting and e-cigarette users may not necessarily point to e-cigarettes as being the cause of these factors. The study has sparked further debate over the impact of new devices in the arena of current smokers. Many contend that there is still not enough data. </p>

<p>The 2014 Crosstalk Symposium 2014, <em>Leveraging Lessons Learned across Behavioral Domains</em> will take place at NCI in Rockville, October 30th to 31st, 2014. The symposium will feature researchers whose work explicitly translates theory and/or methods from one health topic (e.g., physical activity) to another (e.g., tobacco cessation). We will discuss how to overcome interdisciplinary research barriers and try to forge collaborations between NCI and individuals interested in multi-domain approaches. Individuals interested in attending the event should contact Emily Grenen (<a href="mailto:emily.grenen@nih.gov">emily.grenen@nih.gov</a>) for more information.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/cyberseminars/">Process of Cancer Care Cyber Discussion (PC3) series</a> explores the way in which individuals, teams, and healthcare organizations can act and interact to improve health through cancer care delivery. The PC3 series will consider major topics in cancer prevention and control and pose questions for discussion among researchers and providers of care that help elaborate important areas for future research. </p>
