        <img src="/brp/e-newsletter/images/Susan-Czajkowski.jpg" alt="Susan Czajkowski" class="pull-left" style="padding-right:1em;" />
        <p><em>The Health Behaviors Research Branch is one of four branches within the </em><a href="/brp/about.html#branches">Behavioral Research Program</a><em>.</em></p>
        <p>Since joining the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as Chief of the Health Behaviors Research Branch (HBRB) a year and a half ago, I&rsquo;ve been working with branch members and Behavioral Research Program (BRP) colleagues to develop a strategic plan for our branch. </p>
        <p>After a year of strategic visioning retreats and discussions, we have a <a href="/brp/hbrb/strategy.html">draft plan</a> that updates our vision and mission statements, defines branch goals and objectives, delineates the behavioral risk factors of interest, and describes a framework to guide future branch activities and identify priority areas for advancing the branch&rsquo;s strategic goals and objectives. </p>
        <p>In the plan, we identify the behaviorally based cancer risk factors within our branch&rsquo;s mission, including behavioral genetics; diet; physical activity and sedentary behavior; energy balance and obesity; sun safety and tanning; and several emerging cancer risk behaviors of interest, such as alcohol use, sleep and circadian dysfunction, and adherence to cancer-related medical and behavioral regimens. We focus on cancer risk behaviors at all points on the <a href="/od/continuum.html">cancer control continuum</a> – prevention through detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship.</p>
        <p>A key element of the strategic plan is acknowledgement of the importance of <em>multilevel influences</em> on cancer-related health behaviors – including biological, psychological, social, sociocultural, environmental, and policy influences. This multilevel approach is coupled with a <em>translational vision </em>that emphasizes achieving meaningful changes in cancer-related health behaviors through systematic, progressive research. We hope to encourage research across all phases of the translational continuum, including foundational work to understand the influences and features of cancer risk behaviors and their contexts; the design, refinement, and testing of strategies aimed at improving cancer risk behaviors; and implementation of successful interventions within public health, clinical, and community contexts. </p>
        <p>Please visit <a href="/brp/hbrb/about.html">our website</a> to learn more about the HBRB grant portfolio, scientific projects, resources, and our staff members&rsquo; areas of expertise. You can also find a draft of the strategic plan there, and we invite your feedback as we finalize it this summer. Please feel free to reach out to me or any <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffHome.do?grpId=52811&amp;pposId=1421424&amp;cposId=1421449">branch members</a> to share your views on our strategic plan or any issue relevant to cancer-related health behavior research. </p>
        <p>Additionally, this newsletter highlights several recent HBRB projects, including a <a href="#intensive">3-day Sandpit workshop</a> and a <a href="#flashe">FLASHE theme issue</a> in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>. More information about these activities, along with several relevant funding opportunities that may be of interest, is available on our website.</p>
        <p>We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and to hearing your ideas as we finalize our vision for health behavior research at NCI!</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br />

<p>* The U01 funding mechanism is a cooperative agreement that encourages research to uncover the underlying mechanisms that predict and explain how health behaviors develop and are maintained over time. The methods used should utilize intensive, longitudinal within-person protocols that take advantage of advances in mobile and wireless technology and big data analytics. The projects should incorporate theoretical constructs used across health behavior theories, and the results from the studies should inform and enhance our theoretical understanding of behavior change and maintenance. </p>
<p>The U24 funding mechanism solicits proposals to establish a Research Coordinating Center (RCC) that would support the individual U01s associated with this initiative. The RCC will facilitate work across the funded U01s by providing administrative and scientific support including communications, coordination of meetings, and data harmonization, integration, and dissemination activities.</p>

<p id="weight"><strong>Weight Status and Mortality: A Complex Relationship</strong></p>
<p> Those few extra pounds might be more detrimental to your health than you think. A recent analysis by DCCPS-funded researchers reviewed three prospective cohort studies to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index over a 16-year period, and subsequent mortality. They found elevated death rates among those who had been overweight or obese at any point, but the highest death rates were among people who were once overweight or obese, and then lost a lot of weight. Because successful intentional weight loss is rare, it is likely that most of the subjects&rsquo; weight loss was due to illness. </p>

<p id="relationship"><strong>Relationship of Cigarette Smoking Through Adolescence and Weight Status in Young Adulthood </strong></p>
<p>Cancer Prevention Fellow Minal Patel and BRP colleagues <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1462212&amp;bioType=stf">Annette Kaufman</a>, <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439530&amp;bioType=stf">Yvonne Prutzman</a>, and <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1612&bioType=stf">Linda Nebeling</a> recently published a paper on the longitudinal association of cigarette smoking and weight status in youth and young adulthood. Using data from Waves I–IV of the <a href="https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth">National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> , collected between 1995-96 and 2007-08, they identified four distinct trajectories of cigarette smoking in adolescents: nonsmokers (44 percent); early establishers (23 percent); late establishers (21 percent); and former smokers (12 percent). Results indicated that smoking throughout adolescence was modestly associated with lower weight gain into young adulthood. However, weight gain throughout adolescence into young adulthood was prevalent across all four trajectories. Thus, smoking did not mitigate obesity risk. These results have implications for research and interventions to help youth and young adults avoid both smoking and obesity.</p>

The commentary emphasizes three priority needs: 1) standardized demographic and social determinant variables across diverse sources of data; 2) better linkages between spatial, social determinant, and clinical data; and 3) efforts to better connect etiological discoveries to the design of interventions that target disparities. The commentary also highlights barriers for better use of big data in health disparities research.</p>

<img src="images/cancer-deaths-declined.png" alt="2000-2014 Cancer Death Rates Declined" class="pull-left" style="padding-right:1em;" />
<p> Overall cancer death rates continue to decrease in men, women, and children for all major racial and ethnic groups, per the latest <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/">Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2014</a>. The report finds that death rates between 2010-14 decreased for 11 of the 16 most common types of cancer in men and for 13 of the 18 most common types of cancer in women, including lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate cancers. Meanwhile, death rates increased for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and brain in men and for liver and uterine cancers in women. The report finds overall cancer incidence rates – or rates of new cancers – decreased in men but stabilized in women between 1999 and 2013. <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/leadership/director">Doug Lowy</a>, Acting NCI Director, offers his perspective in the Cancer Currents Blog, <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/lowy-report-to-nation">Making Greater Progress Against Cancer&mdash;Not Just a Hope but a Reality</a>.</p>

<p id="genetic"><strong>Parental Smoking Linked to Increased Frequency of Genetic Changes in Children Who Develop Childhood Cancer</strong></p>
<p>A study, funded in part by DCCPS, is the first to link smoking by both parents to somatic deletions in the tumor cells of children who develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common cancer in children under 15. In a study of childhood leukemia cases in California, researchers analyzed data on pre-treatment tumor samples of 559 children with ALL. They found that nearly two-thirds of the tumor samples contained at least one of the eight gene deletions commonly missing in ALL patients. They also found deletions were more common in children whose mothers ever-smoked, smoked throughout pregnancy or breastfeeding, whose fathers smoked preconception, and in children exposed to postnatal passive smoking. Dose–response relationships were observed for paternal smoking during preconception and for maternal smoking during breastfeeding (an increase in mean deletions with increasing cigarettes per day smoked). The cumulative effects of maternal and paternal prenatal smoking with the child&rsquo;s postnatal passive smoking indicate that heavy, long-term tobacco exposure further increases the risk of somatic mutations in children who later develop ALL. Findings support that prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke exposure should be especially limited in children. </p>

<p id="disparity"><strong>Disparity in Breast Cancer Treatment Experience Among Low-acculturated Latina Women</strong></p>
<p>NCI grantee Steven J. Katz and colleagues surveyed 5,080 women with a new diagnosis of breast cancer in Los Angeles County, California, and Georgia between 2013-15 to determine whether any racial or ethnic differences existed in patient perspectives regarding their breast cancer treatment experiences. The pattern of visits with specialists prior to surgery and the percentage of patients reporting high satisfaction with their physician was similar across all racial and ethnic groups. However, the researchers found low acculturated Latinas were less likely to report high clinician communication quality for both surgeons and medical oncologists, were more likely to report a low-autonomy decision style, and were more likely to report receiving too much information compared to other ethnic groups. </p>

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intervention for 3 months and were then followed for 1 year post-treatment. The researchers found both treatments showed benefits over 1 year, and TCC was just as effective as CBT-I in improving sleep symptoms with the additional benefit of improving symptoms of depression and fatigue. CBT-I is considered the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for treating insomnia. </p>

<p id="light-filter"><strong>'Light' Filtered Cigarettes Associated with an Increased Rate of Lung Adenocarcinoma Among Smokers </strong></p>
<p>An in-depth analysis of published scientific literature and internal tobacco company documents, conducted by NCI- and FDA-funded researchers, has found a relationship between the addition of ventilation holes in cigarettes and the rise in lung adenocarcinomas among smokers seen since the early 1970s. Beginning in the mid-1960s, low tar or light cigarettes were falsely marketed and promoted by the tobacco industry as less harmful than full-flavor cigarettes, promising reduced exposure to tar and nicotine (REF to RICO trial). A central feature of this strategy was the introduction of ventilation holes in cigarette filters. However, smokers who switched to light cigarettes tend to inhale more smoke to maintain their nicotine intake and have a false perception that light cigarettes lower their health risks. Smokers of light/low tar cigarettes also showed an increase in adenocarcinoma rates relative to other lung cancer subtypes. According to the newly published research, the association of light/low tar cigarettes with adenocarcinoma may be attributed in part to filter ventilation, which alters tobacco combustion and changes the chemical composition and mix of toxicants in tobacco smoke. The paper is accompanied by an editorial that explores the implications for FDA regulation of the new research.</p>

<p>From July 10 to August 9, 2017, NCI and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/osh/index.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Office on Smoking and Health</a> (OSH) are partnering on <a href="https://bit.ly/CDC30SFD"><em>30 Smokefree Days</em></a>, an online Facebook event that supports people who want to quit smoking. Throughout the 30-day event, participants will receive links to quit resources, quit tips, encouragement, milestone badges, and exclusive video content with words of advice from <em>Tips From Former Smokers™</em> participants. In addition, Tobacco Cessation Research Branch Program Directors <a href="https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=1439530&bioType=stf">Yvonne Prutzman</a> and <a href="https://researchtoreality.cancer.gov/presenter/erik-augustson-phd-mph">Erik Augustson</a> and other NCI staff will host livestream Facebook Live events throughout the initiative that will cover specific topics relevant to cessation, provide guidance on successful quit skills, and answer smokers&rsquo; questions.</p>
<p id="tutorials"><strong>New Tutorials on Preparing and Submitting an NIH Grant Application</strong></p>
<p>The NIH Extramural Program developed a new set of tutorials to assist investigators who are new to the NIH grant process. The four-part interactive series offers the basics of preparing, writing, and submitting your application. Tutorials are between 4 to 11 minutes each and are broken into chapters so users can easily navigate between sections. The tutorials also link to additional resources and transcripts. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/video/index.htm">Watch the grant tutorials &raquo;</a></p>

<p id="applications"><strong>New NIH Form to Request Assignments for Incoming Grant Applications</strong></p>
<p>As of March 24, 2017, principal investigators (PI) should use <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-d/general/g.600-phs-assignment-request-form.htm">SF424 (R&amp;R) Forms Version D</a> when requesting specific application assignments and review requests for incoming grant applications. This information was previously collected in the cover letter attachment. The benefit of using this form is that it allows PIs to request study sections assignment and list appropriate expertise. In some cases, the reviewing institute is pre-determined, so assignment requests cannot be honored. And, like the cover letter, this form is not considered part of the application and does not get uploaded into the eGrants file.</p>
<p id="policies"><strong>New NIH Clinical Trials Policies </strong></p>
<p>In September 2016, the NIH released new policies and processes to help improve NIH&rsquo;s stewardship, accountability, and transparency of clinical trials. Although these policies and efforts were developed primarily with the traditional biomedical clinical trial in mind, they are applicable to social and behavioral trials as well. As a starting point, a new NIH definition of the term &ldquo;clinical trial&rdquo; was developed. It is defined as &ldquo;A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.&rdquo; Once determined that your research meets the NIH definition of a clinical trial, behavioral and social science researchers need to know and adhere to several recently released NIH clinical trials policies and efforts that span from grant submission through dissemination of findings. The NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research published a comprehensive <a href="https://obssr.od.nih.gov/new-nih-clinical-trials-policies-implications-for-behavioral-and-social-science-researchers/">article</a> to help researchers adhere to these new policies and efforts.</p>

<p id="intensive"><strong>Intensive Workshop Brings Researchers Together from United States and United Kingdom</strong></p>
<p>The Behavioral Research Program, in partnership with <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/">Cancer Research United Kingdom</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a> (CRUK), hosted a 3-day residential &ldquo;Sandpit&rdquo; workshop (i.e., ideas lab) on April 24-26, 2017, in Potomac, Maryland. A broad, multidisciplinary group of participants engaged in an intensive, interactive experience to develop innovative research project ideas that cut across behavioral domains, professional sectors, and geographic boundaries to address five key cancer-related health behaviors: tobacco use, alcohol consumption, dietary behavior, physical activity, and UV exposure. During the workshop, participants formed multidisciplinary teams, refined project ideas, and received guidance on applying for seed funding from CRUK to test the feasibility of their ideas. Five projects were recommended for CRUK grant seed-funding and invited to submit more detailed applications, with the aim that projects will begin August 2017. </p>
