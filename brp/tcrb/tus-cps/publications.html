The home is the primary source of exposure to SHS for infants and children and a major source of SHS exposure for nonsmoking adults. To assess trends in national and state-specific prevalence of home "no smoking" rules (i.e., smoke-free home rules), CDC analyzed data from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey for 1992-1993, 1998-1999, and 2003. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the national prevalence of households with smoke-free home rules in the United States increased significantly, from 43.2% during 1992-1993 to 72.2% in 2003. During this period, the national prevalence of such rules increased from 9.6% to 31.8% among households with at least one smoker and from 56.8% to 83.5% among households with no smoker. A regression analysis of the rate of change over time indicated that the increase in smoke-free homes during this period was not significantly different for households with at least one smoker compared with households with no smoker. Statistically significant increases in the prevalence of smoke-free home rules were also observed in all states, although variation was observed among states. Comprehensive tobacco-control measures, including 1) evidence-based interventions to help smokers quit, 2) policies making workplaces and public places smoke-free, 3) voluntary rules making homes smoke-free, and 4) initiatives to educate the public regarding the health effects of SHS, are needed to further reduce exposure of nonsmokers to SHS.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522588?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Methods for Assessing Risk Factors, Guidance & Policy Research, Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> epidemiology, Family Characteristics, Housing, Humans, Population Surveillance, Prevalence, prevention & control, Smoking, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, trends, United States, </td></tr><tr><td></td><td> <strong>Do Higher Tobacco Taxes Reduce Adult Smoking?

New Evidence of the Effect of Recent Cigarette Tax Increases on Adult Smoking</strong> <br><br> <br> 2013 Jun 1 <br><p>There is a general consensus among policymakers that raising tobacco taxes reduces cigarette consumption. However, evidence that tobacco taxes reduce adult smoking is relatively sparse. In this paper, we extend the literature in two ways: using data from the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements we focus on recent, large tax changes, which provide the best opportunity to empirically observe a response in cigarette consumption, and employ a novel paired difference-in-differences technique to estimate the association between tax increases and cigarette consumption. Estimates indicate that, for adults, the association between cigarette taxes and either smoking participation or smoking intensity is negative, small, and not usually statistically significant. Our evidence suggests that increases in cigarette taxes are associated with small decreases in cigarette consumption and that it will take sizable tax increases, on the order of 100%, to decrease smoking by as much as 5%.

This survey provided detailed data associated with state tobacco-use control programs and their essential components (e.g., budgets, planning, coalitions, surveillance systems, smoking cessation programs, educational activities, legislative actions, and health department policies). States vary widely in the strength and coverage of their programs for preventing and controlling tobacco use. The ASTHO survey data may be used to help plan and evaluate state health department programs as part of an effort to prevent chronic diseases related to tobacco use. Outcomes of state activities may be evaluated through surveys such as CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the Bureau of the Census. Future surveys of state activities for controlling the use of tobacco may be included in the evaluation of the upcoming (1993) American Stop Smoking Intervention Study (ASSIST), which is cosponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1956089?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Adult, Data Collection, Health Education, Health Promotion, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Population Surveillance, prevention & control, Smoking, State Health Plans, United States, </td></tr><tr><td></td><td> <strong>Raising the Excise Tax on Cigarettes: Effects on Health and the Federal Budget</strong> <br><br> <br> 2012 Jun 13 <br><br> <br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal4">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal4" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Raising the Excise Tax on Cigarettes: Effects on Health and the Federal Budget</strong> <br><br> <br> 2012 Jun 13 <br><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43319" target="_blank">Visit this publication's Web page</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td> <strong>Tobacco use among U.S. racial/ethnic minority groups--African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Hispanics.

It is known that tobacco use is a major health risk for groups that have low SES. However, there is some evidence that tobacco use among certain immigrant groups is lower than among the respective native-born ethnic group, and that immigrant assimilation is positively related to tobacco use. We investigated the relationship between immigrant generation and daily smoking, using the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS), 1995-96, a national data set representative of the US general and immigrant populations. Our multivariate logistic regression analysis of the relationship between immigrant generation and daily smoker status (n=221,798) showed that after controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, SES variables (i.e. equivalized household income, education, occupation), and central-city residence, the odds of being a daily smoker were highest among US-born individuals of US-born parents (reference group) and lowest among foreign-born individuals (95% CI: 0.54-0.62). Being a second-generation immigrant (i.e. US born) with two immigrant parents also conferred a protective effective from smoking (95% CI: 0.64-0.77). However, having only one foreign-born parent was not protective against smoking. Testing for interaction effects, we also found that being foreign born and being second generation with two immigrant parents were especially protective against smoking among females (vis-à-vis males); racial/ethnic minorities (vis-à-vis whites); and low-income individuals (vis-à-vis high-income individuals). We discuss possible mechanisms that may explain the protective effect against smoking of being foreign born and being second generation with two immigrant parents, including differences in the stage of the tobacco epidemic between immigrants' countries of origin and the US, the "healthy immigrant effect", and anti-smoking socialization in immigrant families.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970233?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Emigration and Immigration, epidemiology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Smoking, Social Class, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Agaku IT, Ayo-Yusuf OA, Vardavas CI, </td><td> <strong>A comparison of cessation counseling received by current smokers at US dentist and physician offices during 2010-2011.</strong> <br> Agaku IT, Ayo-Yusuf OA, Vardavas CI, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article <br> 2014 Aug <br> American journal of public health 104 (8) :e67-75 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal7">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal7" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>A comparison of cessation counseling received by current smokers at US dentist and physician offices during 2010-2011.</strong> <br> Agaku IT, Ayo-Yusuf OA, Vardavas CI, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article <br> 2014 Aug <br><p>OBJECTIVES: We compared patient-reported receipt of smoking cessation counseling from US dentists and physicians. METHODS: We analyzed the 2010 to 2011 Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey to assess receipt of smoking cessation advice and assistance by a current smoker from a dentist or physician in the past 12 months. RESULTS: Current adult smokers were significantly less likely to be advised to quit smoking during a visit to a dentist (31.2%) than to a physician (64.8%). Among physician patients who were advised to quit, 52.7% received at least 1 form of assistance beyond the simple advice to quit; 24.5% of dental patients received such assistance (P&lt;.05). Approximately 9.4 million smokers who visited a dentist in 2010 to 2011 did not receive any cessation counseling. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a need for intensified efforts to increase dentist involvement in cessation counseling. System-level changes, coupled with regular training, may enhance self-efficacy of dentists in engaging patients in tobacco cessation counseling.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922172?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Professional Advice, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adult, Aged, Dentists, Directive Counseling, epidemiology, Female, Health Care Surveys, Humans, Male, methods, Middle Aged, Physicians, prevention & control, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Agaku IT, Odukoya OO, Olufajo O, Filippidis FT, Vardavas CI, </td><td> <strong>Support for smoke-free cars when children are present: a secondary analysis of 164,819 U.S. adults in 2010/2011.</strong> <br> Agaku IT, Odukoya OO, Olufajo O, Filippidis FT, Vardavas CI, <br> Journal Article <br> 2014 Nov <br> European journal of pediatrics 173 (11) :1459-66 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal8">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal8" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Support for smoke-free cars when children are present: a secondary analysis of 164,819 U.S. adults in 2010/2011.</strong> <br> Agaku IT, Odukoya OO, Olufajo O, Filippidis FT, Vardavas CI, <br> Journal Article <br> 2014 Nov <br><p>Comprehensive smoke-free legislations prohibiting smoking in indoor areas of workplaces, bars, and restaurants have been adopted in most of the USA; however, limited efforts have focused on regulating secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in the family car. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants and national/state-specific population support for smoke-free cars, in the presence of any occupant in general, but particularly when children are present. National data of US adults aged ≥18 years (n = 164,819) were obtained from the 2010/2011 Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey. Among all US adults, a significantly greater proportion supported smoke-free cars when it was specified that the occupant was a child compared to when not specified (93.4 vs. 73.7 %, p&lt;0.05). Age, race/ethnicity, gender, current tobacco use, marital status, and the existence of household smoke-free regulations all mediated population support for smoke-free cars. CONCLUSION: While differences within the US population were noted, this study however showed overwhelming support for smoke-free car policies, particularly when children are present. Policies which prohibit smoking in indoor or confined areas such as cars may benefit public health by protecting nonsmoking children and adults from involuntary SHS exposure.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889334?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, </td><td> Lung </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Ahijevych K, Ford J, </td><td> <strong>The relationships between menthol cigarette preference and state tobacco control policies on smoking behaviors of young adult smokers in the 2006-07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys (TUS CPS).</strong> <br> Ahijevych K, Ford J, <br> Journal Article <br> 2010 Dec <br> Addiction (Abingdon, England) 105 Suppl 1 :46-54 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal9">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal9" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The relationships between menthol cigarette preference and state tobacco control policies on smoking behaviors of young adult smokers in the 2006-07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys (TUS CPS).</strong> <br> Ahijevych K, Ford J, <br> Journal Article <br> 2010 Dec <br><p>AIM: To examine relationships between the preference for menthol cigarettes and young adult smoking behaviors, including the extent to which state tobacco control policies moderate these relationships. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design using secondary data from the 2006-07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys (TUS CPS) surveys appended with 2006 state-policy data. SETTING: United States nationally representative survey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2241 young adult daily smokers and 688 young adult non-daily smokers. MEASUREMENTS: The two dependent variables of smoking behaviors were smoking first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking (TTF) and number of cigarettes smoked per day (cpd). Primary independent variables included menthol brand preference and state tobacco control policies (youth access laws, clean indoor air laws and cigarette excise taxes), adjusting for controls. FINDINGS: Among daily smokers, there were no significant associations between menthol brand preference and TTF or cpd. However, lower educational attainment, not being in the labor force and the lack of home smoking rules were associated positively with shorter TTF, being white and the lack of home smoking rules were associated positively with cpd. Among daily smokers, state excise taxes were associated negatively with higher cpd. Among non-daily smokers, menthol brand preference was associated positively with shorter TTF, but associations did not vary with state tobacco control policies. Menthol brand preference was not associated significantly with cpd, but male gender, unmarried status and the lack of home smoking rules were associated positively with greater cpd among non-daily smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Young adult non-daily smokers who preferred menthol cigarettes were significantly more dependent than those who preferred non-menthol cigarettes, as shown through the shorter TTF.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were non-Hispanic white daily smokers (aged 20-64 years, n=24 317) from the Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey (1992-2002). We compared age-specific trends in consumption among daily smokers in three groups of states with differing tobacco control initiatives: California (CA; high cigarette price/comprehensive programme), New York and New Jersey (high cigarette price/no comprehensive programme), and tobacco-growing states (TGS; low cigarette price/no comprehensive programme). RESULTS: There was a general decline in cigarette consumption across all age groups in each category of states between 1992 and 2002, except the oldest age group in the TGS. The largest annual decline in the average number of cigarettes per day was observed among daily smokers in CA who were aged > or=35 years (-0.41 cigarettes/day/year (95% CI -0.52 to -0.3)). This rate was significantly higher than the -0.22 cigarettes/day/year (95% CI -0.3 to -0.16; p&lt;0.02) observed in same-age daily smokers from New York and New Jersey, and significantly higher than the rate in same-age daily smokers from the TGS (-0.15 cigarettes/day/year (95% CI -0.22 to -0.08; p&lt;0.002)). There were no significant differences across state groups in the decline observed in daily smokers aged 20-34 years. In 2002, only 12% of daily smokers in CA smoked more than a pack per day, which was significantly lower than the 17% in New York and New Jersey, which again was significantly lower than the 25% in the TGS. CONCLUSIONS: The California Tobacco Control Program was associated with significant declines in cigarette consumption among daily smokers aged > or=35 years of age, which in turn should lead to declines in tobacco-related health effects. The decline in consumption among young adult smokers was a national trend.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17400945?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598465">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Age Factors, California, epidemiology, Female, Health Promotion, Humans, Male, methods, Middle Aged, New Jersey, New York, prevention & control, Program Evaluation, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, </td></tr><tr><td> Alamar B, Glantz SA, </td><td> <strong>Effect of increased social unacceptability of cigarette smoking on reduction in cigarette consumption.</strong> <br> Alamar B, Glantz SA, <br> Comparative Study Evaluation Studies Journal Article <br> 2006 Aug <br> American journal of public health 96 (8) :1359-63 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal11">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal11" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Effect of increased social unacceptability of cigarette smoking on reduction in cigarette consumption.</strong> <br> Alamar B, Glantz SA, <br> Comparative Study Evaluation Studies Journal Article <br> 2006 Aug <br><p>Taxes on cigarettes have long been used to help reduce cigarette consumption.

DESIGN: Data for this cross-sectional study were obtained from the 2006 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS CPS), a large national survey representative of the civilian population, containing approximately 240,000 respondents. The total sample for the current study was 30,176. MEASUREMENTS: The TUS CPS regularly collects data on cigarette prevalence, quitting behaviors, smoking history and consumption patterns. We performed a logistic regression with 'life-time quitting smoking for 1 day or longer because they were trying to quit' as outcome variable. Independent variables included type of occupation, employer-sponsored cessation programs and policies and menthol status. FINDINGS: When controlling for occupational status and work-place policies, there were no differences for menthol versus non-menthol smokers on quitting behaviors [odds ratio (OR)=0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.83, 1.15]. Service workers were less likely to quit compared with white-collar workers (OR=0.80; 95% CI=0.69, 0.94), and those with no employer-sponsored cessation program were less likely to quit (OR=0.70; 95% CI=0.60, 0.83). White-collar workers, compared with blue-collar and service workers, were more likely to have a smoking policy in the work area (93% versus 86% versus 88%, respectively).

The present study uses an ecological design to quantify trends in paediatric encounters for OM concurrent with a period of decline of an important risk factor, secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Annual paediatric ambulatory visit and hospital discharge rates for children ≤ 6 years with OM as primary diagnosis were computed with nationally representative data for 1993-2006. Percentages of households with children ≤ 6 years and no-smoking rules were computed using Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey data. Average annual percentage changes were determined for covariate-adjusted rates of paediatric encounters for OM using joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: While percentages of homes with children and no-smoking rules increased by 89% from 45.5% in 1993 to 86.1% in 2006, average annual covariate-adjusted paediatric encounters for OM decreased by 4.6% (95% CI 4.5% to 4.8%) for ambulatory visits and by 9.8% (95% CI 9.1% to 10.6%) for hospital discharges. Coverage by 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV7) increased since 2002, while little variation occurred in other potentially associated risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric encounter rates for OM decreased steadily over a 13-year period reversing a previously reported long-term increasing trend reported. Reduced SHS exposure, PCV7 coverage since 2002 and other factors may have contributed to the decline.

METHODS: Adult survey data from the tobacco use supplement of the Current Population Survey in 1992-93 and 1995-96 were used to reconstruct the age at which individuals began to smoke and the calendar year in which they were that age. From these data, the number of individuals who began a calendar year as never smokers and who were aged 12-17 years during that year could be estimated and formed the denominator of the initiation rate. The number of these individuals who reported taking up smoking during that year formed the numerator of the initiation rate. RESULTS: Initiation rates among male adolescents in each of the three racial/ethnic groups have declined since 1945. However, since 1983, initiation rates among male adolescents overall have increased. Non-Hispanic white male adolescents generally initiated cigarette smoking at higher rates than Hispanic or African American male adolescents. Initiation rates among Hispanic male adolescents have not been statistically different from initiation rates among African American male adolescents. From 1978 to 1982, initiation rates among Hispanic and African American male adolescents experienced a sharp decline, and the rate of decline was steeper than that experienced by non-Hispanic white male adolescents. Initiation rates among female adolescents have increased since 1940, catching up to male adolescent initiation rates by the mid 1970s. Initiation rates among female adolescents appeared to level off or increased slightly again from the mid 1980s to 1990. Non-Hispanic white female adolescents generally initiate cigarette smoking at higher rates than Hispanic or African American female adolescents. Initiation rates among non-Hispanic white and African American female adolescents equalled the initiation rates of their male counterparts by the mid 1970s, but initiation rates among Hispanic female adolescents did not overlap with initiation rates of Hispanic male adolescents until 1990. From 1975 to 1980, initiation rates among African American female adolescents decreased sharply, but, unlike initiation rates among the two other ethnic groups, rates continued to decline from 1984 to 1990. CONCLUSIONS: Different patterns of increasing and decreasing smoking initiation among sex and ethnic adolescent groups suggest the effect of varying social and cultural influences. These findings support the importance of including ethnic factors in studies of smoking behaviour.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10841585?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1766284">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Adult, African Americans, Age Distribution, Age of Onset, Aged, epidemiology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, psychology, Questionnaires, Retrospective Studies, Sex Distribution, Smoking, statistics & numerical data, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Anderson C, Burns DM, Major J, Vaughn JW, Shanks TG, </td><td> <strong>Chapter 8.

METHODS: BRFSS telephone survey estimates were compared with estimates from the US Census CPS tobacco-use supplements (the CPS sample frame includes persons in households without telephones). Weighted overall and sex- and race-specific BRFSS and CPS state estimates of adults smoking were analyzed for 1985, 1989, and 1992/1993. RESULTS: Overall estimates of smoking prevalence from the BRFSS were slightly lower than estimates from CPS (median difference: -2.0 percentage points in 1985, -0.7 in 1989, and -1.9 in 1992/1993; P &lt; .05 for all comparisons), but there was variation among states. Differences between BRFSS and CPS estimates were larger among men than among women and larger among Blacks than among Hispanics or Whites; for most states, these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The BRFSS generally provides state estimates of smoking prevalence similar to those obtained from CPS, and these are appropriate for ongoing state surveillance of smoking prevalence.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9357350?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1381131">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Methods for Assessing Risk Factors, Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Censuses, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, Female, Humans, Male, methods, Population Surveillance, Prevalence, Risk-Taking, Smoking, Telephone, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Augustson E, Marcus S, </td><td> <strong>Use of the current population survey to characterize subpopulations of continued smokers: a national perspective on the "hardcore" smoker phenomenon.</strong> <br> Augustson E, Marcus S, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2004 Aug <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 6 (4) :621-9 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal18">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal18" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Use of the current population survey to characterize subpopulations of continued smokers: a national perspective on the "hardcore" smoker phenomenon.</strong> <br> Augustson E, Marcus S, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2004 Aug <br><p>The existence of "hardcore" smokers, those most likely to have substantial difficulty quitting, may have far reaching impact on how to best allocate cessation resources. It has been suggested that hardcore smokers make up only a small fraction of current smokers and therefore do not represent a significant public health problem. However, little is known about the prevalence and nature of this subgroup of smokers in the United States. Based on a national sample, the 1998-1999 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, we categorized, based on smoking pattern, groups of current smokers who were over age 25 years (N=33,568). We compared hardcore smokers with other groups of current smokers on demographic, environmental, and smoking variables to assess whether hardcore smokers represent a unique group. Hardcore smokers were defined as established daily smokers, consuming 15 or more cigarettes per day with no reported history of quit attempts. Hardcore smokers represent 13.7% of all current smokers and 17.6% of all established smokers. They are more likely to be male, unmarried, not in the work force, and have lower education. They also are more likely to have started smoking at a younger age, smoke more, and are less likely to report contact with smoking restrictions. This analysis suggests that hardcore smokers are distinct from other groups of smokers. These results also indicate that hardcore smokers account for a substantial proportion of smokers and as such may represent a significant public health challenge that needs to be addressed.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15370158?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Age of Onset, Aged, epidemiology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Augustson EM, Barzani D, Rutten LJ, Marcus S, </td><td> <strong>Gender differences among hardcore smokers: an analysis of the tobacco use supplement of the current population survey.</strong> <br> Augustson EM, Barzani D, Rutten LJ, Marcus S, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2008 Sep <br> Journal of women's health (2002) 17 (7) :1167-73 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal19">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal19" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Gender differences among hardcore smokers: an analysis of the tobacco use supplement of the current population survey.</strong> <br> Augustson EM, Barzani D, Rutten LJ, Marcus S, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2008 Sep <br><p>BACKGROUND: Despite significant declines in smoking rates in the United States, a substantial percentage of adults continue to smoke. Improved understanding of current smokers and their contact with sources of cessation support future tobacco control efforts. Recent evidence suggests that hardcore smokers, established smokers without a history of quit attempts, have less contact with cessation support. Although gender is among the major factors that influence smoking cessation, no research is available on gender differences among hardcore smokers. METHODS: Demographic, environmental, and smoking-related characteristics of female hardcore smokers and male hardcore smokers and other female smokers were examined. Data from 17,777 smokers from the 2003 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with female hardcore smokers, male hardcore smokers were more likely to have contact with smoking restrictions at work (OR=1.69) and at home (OR=1.45). Compared with female hardcore smokers, female other smokers were more likely to have seen a healthcare provider during the past year who advised them to quit smoking (OR=1.39) and more likely to have smoking restrictions at work (OR=1.25) and at home (OR=2.32)). Measures of nicotine dependence suggested that female hardcore smokers were less dependent than male hardcore smokers but more dependent than other female smokers.

Data from the 1995/96, 1998, 2000, and 2001/02 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey were used to estimate concurrent use of tobacco among cigarette smokers among adults ages 18 years and older (n for all 4 survey groups=552,804). Concurrent use of tobacco fluctuated over the survey periods for current smokers and ranged from 3.7% in 1995/96 to 7.9% in 1998. Results from the multivariate logistic regression indicate that male current, daily, and intermittent smokers had substantially higher odds of concurrent use (OR=12.9, 11.7, 17.2, respectively) than their female counterparts. Age, race/ethnicity, geographic region, income, and survey years were significantly associated with concurrent use among current and daily smokers; for intermittent smokers, these variables and occupation were significantly associated with concurrent use. The strongest correlates for multiple tobacco use among cigarettes smokers were being male and Non-Hispanic White. These factors should be considered when planning tobacco prevention and control efforts. In addition, surveillance efforts should continue to monitor changes in concurrent use and further investigate the increased risk of cancer among smokers who also use other forms of tobacco.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053653?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2277213">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Smokeless Tobacco, Tobacco - Other Tobacco Products, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Age Distribution, Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, Demography, epidemiology, ethnology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Socioeconomic Factors, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Use Disorder, Tobacco, Smokeless, </td></tr><tr><td> Baluja KF, Park J, Myers D, </td><td> <strong>Inclusion of immigrant status in smoking prevalence statistics.</strong> <br> Baluja KF, Park J, Myers D, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2003 Apr <br> American journal of public health 93 (4) :642-6 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal21">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal21" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Inclusion of immigrant status in smoking prevalence statistics.</strong> <br> Baluja KF, Park J, Myers D, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2003 Apr <br><p>OBJECTIVES: Data from the 1995-1996 and 1998-1999 Current Population Survey tobacco use supplements were used to examine smoking prevalence statistics by race/ethnicity and immigrant status.

METHODS: Annual state-specific SIDS cases were computed using period linked birth/infant death files; the prevalence of 100% smoke-free homes with infants using Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey data, and percentage of infants in supine sleep position from National Infant Sleep Position data, for years 1995-2006. Incidence rate ratios relating trends in SIDS cases and risk factors were determined using time-series negative binomial regression. Population-level health effects were assessed with secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure population attributable fractions and excess attributable SIDS deaths. RESULTS: For every 1% absolute increase in the prevalence of smoke-free homes with infants, SIDS rates decreased 0.4% from 1995 to 2006, controlling for supine sleep position. Nationally, it is possible that 20% of the 1326 total SIDS cases were attributable to childhood SHS exposure at home in 2006 with potentially 534 fewer infant deaths attributable to SHS exposure in 2006 than in 1995, owing to an increasing prevalence of 100% smoke-free homes with infants. Cumulatively, 4402 (lower 95% CI) to 6406 (upper 95% CI) excess SIDS cases may have been attributable to SHS exposure in the home over the 12-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of voluntary restrictions on smoking inside the home may present a public health benefit for infants in their first year of life. In light of inherent ecological study design limitations, these results warrant further individual level research linking postnatal SHS exposure and SIDS.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21474502?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, </td><td></td><td> Adult, adverse effects, Air Pollution, Indoor, epidemiology, etiology, Family Health, Female, Housing, Humans, Infant, Infant Care, methods, Mortality, physiology, Prevalence, prevention & control, Risk Factors, Sleep, statistics & numerical data, Sudden Infant Death, Supine Position, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, trends, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Biener L, Garrett CA, Gilpin EA, Roman AM, Currivan DB, </td><td> <strong>Consequences of declining survey response rates for smoking prevalence estimates.</strong> <br> Biener L, Garrett CA, Gilpin EA, Roman AM, Currivan DB, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2004 Oct <br> American journal of preventive medicine 27 (3) :254-7 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal23">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal23" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Consequences of declining survey response rates for smoking prevalence estimates.</strong> <br> Biener L, Garrett CA, Gilpin EA, Roman AM, Currivan DB, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2004 Oct <br><p>BACKGROUND: Response rates have been declining in statewide tobacco surveys.

State estimates of smoking prevalence at three times were compared with estimates from the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement (CPS-TUS), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. RESULTS: Under- and over-representation of population subgroups has not changed as response rates have declined. Smoking prevalence estimates from state surveys remain relatively close to the state-specific CPS-TUS estimates.

METHODS: Logistic regressions were estimated for a variety of smoking outcomes, controlling for individual demographic characteristics, state economic characteristics, and state, year, and month fixed effects, using data on 1380 bartenders from the 1992-2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey combined with data on SCIALs from ImpacTeen. RESULTS: State restrictions on smoking in bars are negatively associated with whether a bartender smokes, with a 1-point increase in restrictiveness (on a scale of 0-3) associated with a 5.3% reduction in the odds of smoking. Bar SCIALs are positively associated with the likelihood a bartender reports never having smoked cigarettes but not with the likelihood a bartender reports having been a former smoker. CONCLUSION: State clean indoor air laws covering bars appear to reduce smoking among bartenders primarily by changing the composition of the bartender workforce with respect to smoking rather than by reducing smoking among people already employed as bartenders when restrictions are adopted. Such laws may nonetheless be an important public health tool for reducing secondhand smoke.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059605?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, </td><td></td><td> Air Pollution, Indoor, epidemiology, Government Regulation, Health Surveys, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Logistic Models, prevention & control, Public Policy, Restaurants, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, State Government, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Bitler MP, Carpenter CS, Zavodny M, </td><td> <strong>Effects of venue-specific state clean indoor air laws on smoking-related outcomes.</strong> <br> Bitler MP, Carpenter CS, Zavodny M, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2010 Dec <br> Health economics 19 (12) :1425-40 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal25">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal25" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Effects of venue-specific state clean indoor air laws on smoking-related outcomes.</strong> <br> Bitler MP, Carpenter CS, Zavodny M, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2010 Dec <br><p>A large literature has documented relationships between state clean indoor air laws (SCIALs) and smoking-related outcomes in the United States. These laws vary within states over time and across venues such as schools, government buildings, and bars. Few studies, however, have evaluated whether the effects of SCIALs are plausibly concentrated among workers who should have been directly affected because they worked at locations covered by the venue-specific restrictions. We fill this gap in the literature using data on private sector workers, government employees, school workers, eating and drinking place workers, and bartenders from the 1992-2007 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. Our quasi-experimental models indicate robust effects of SCIALs restricting smoking in bars: these laws significantly increased the presence of workplace smoking restrictions as reported by bartenders and reduced the fraction of bartenders who smoke. We do not, however, find that SCIALs in private workplaces, government workplaces, schools, or restaurants increased the presence of workplace smoking restrictions among groups of workers working in venues covered by these laws. This suggests that the smoking reductions associated with SCIALs in previous research are unlikely to have been directly caused by effects of workplace smoking restrictions on workers.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19998352?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Policy, Prevention, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Air Pollution, Indoor, classification, epidemiology, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Occupational Health, prevention & control, Regression Analysis, Smoking, State Government, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Bourne DM, Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, </td><td> <strong>Occupational disparities in smoke-free workplace policies in Arkansas.</strong> <br> Bourne DM, Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Nov <br> The Journal of the Arkansas Medical Society 101 (5) :148-54 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal26">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal26" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Occupational disparities in smoke-free workplace policies in Arkansas.</strong> <br> Bourne DM, Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Nov <br><p>This report summarizes trends in Arkansas to protect workers from the documented harm caused by secondhand smoke.

Since the exact year of the onset was not available, the discrepancy (termed shift) in self-reports was explored. The study was targeted at establishing the relationships between the prevalence and the magnitude of shifting and respondent and survey characteristics and identifying the key factors contributing to forward and backward shifting. METHODS: The 2002-2003 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey was administered using phone and in-person interviews to the same respondents in 2002 and 2003. The regular smoking onset age, reported by current and former smokers during both years, was used. All statistical analyses incorporated replicate weights to adjust for the complex survey design. RESULTS: In our sample, about 31.6% (31.8%) of respondents forwardly (backwardly) shifted the smoking onset age, with the mean magnitude of discrepancy about 2.7 years (both directions). The elapsed time since the onset was shown to be the most important considered predictor of prevalence of shifting. The prevalence of forward (backward) shifting tends to increase (decrease) as elapsed time increases. Furthermore, the discrepancy in forwardly shifted responses tends to increase, on average, with elapsed time. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that both forward and backward shifting may be prevalent in reports on smoking onset age. The extent of shifting depends on elapsed time since the onset (and therefore, the respondent's age) and other respondent and survey characteristics. The findings are consistent with presence of both forward and backward telescoping biases.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24379148?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015091">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Research Methodology, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Burns DM, Major JM, Anderson CM, Vaughn JW, </td><td> <strong>Chapter 8.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different information systems and surveys were used. Those used in the study herein presented include the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 1991-2001, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 1999-2001, the National Health Interview Survey, 1978-2001, the Current Population Survey, 1998-1999, The National Health Vital Statistics, 1999, and the U.S. Census Bureau, 2001. RESULTS: A decreased prevalence of cigarette smoking has been observed in the U.S. both in young persons and adults. A decreased prevalence among subjects reporting Mexican and Mexican-American (combined) ethnicity was also noted. Young adults and adults of Mexican or Mexican-American origin smoke cigarettes less frequently than non-Hispanic whites or American Indians. However, this lower rate among Mexicans and Mexican-Americans is due mainly to the lower use of cigarettes among Mexican-American and Mexican women (combined). Although these women have a lower prevalence of cigarette smoking than non-Hispanic white females, among Mexican-American and Mexican males (combined) cigarette smoking may be as common as in non-Hispanic white males. Moreover, those who identify themselves as Mexican-American have higher cigarette use than those who identify themselves as Mexicans. Finally, Mexican and Mexican-American women (combined) of a lower education level are more prone to smoking during pregnancy than females of the same group with a higher education level. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows differences by age, sex, self-definition of ethnicity (Mexican or Mexican-American), and education level, regarding smoking among Mexicans or persons with a Mexican background living in the United States. It is crucial to understand the demographic changes and trends and patterns among Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the U.S. so as to design and implement smoking control programs that are efficient, culturally sensitive, and designed specifically for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans.

Previous studies have described sociodemographic and geographic variation in smoking across the U.S., providing insight to public health scientists aiming to identify high-risk populations and places in the absence of local data. This study extends previous research by considering the influence of a combination of covariates at the U.S. state, core-based statistical area (CBSA), and individual levels, focusing on a time period when smoking prevalence has decreased significantly but disparities remain. We applied multilevel regression to the 2006-2007 Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement. We conducted a four-level logistic regression model and evaluated fixed and random effects to quantify the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level, area poverty at the CBSA level, and indoor smoking legislation and cigarette taxes at the state level, to the probability of smoking at the individual level and the variance in smoking at the state and CBSA levels. Sociodemographic covariates were significant predictors of smoking and explained 67% of variance at the CBSA level alone but only 41% at the state level. Contextual covariates alone, such as indoor smoking legislation and cigarette taxes at the state level and area poverty at the CBSA level, explained a larger proportion of state variance (82%) but individually had modest statistical significance. Our findings emphasize the continued disparities in smoking patterns in the U.S. despite the decrease of smoking prevalence in the past decade; as well as the ongoing necessity to consider associations with both compositional and contextual factors. Patterns of residual variance emphasize the continued need to identify and evaluate appropriate contextual covariates, with more refined geographic resolution than that available from national surveys at present.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21813218?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Modeling, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Data Collection, Demography, epidemiology, Female, Geography, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Smoking, Social Class, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Cheng KW, Glantz SA, Lightwood JM, </td><td> <strong>Association between smokefree laws and voluntary smokefree-home rules.</strong> <br> Cheng KW, Glantz SA, Lightwood JM, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2011 Dec <br> American journal of preventive medicine 41 (6) :566-72 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal33">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal33" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Association between smokefree laws and voluntary smokefree-home rules.</strong> <br> Cheng KW, Glantz SA, Lightwood JM, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2011 Dec <br><p>BACKGROUND: More states and localities are passing restrictions on smoking in public places and workplaces. PURPOSE: To determine what, if any, association exists between enactment of strong laws making public places or workplaces smokefree on adoption of voluntary smokefree-home policies, particularly whether such laws are associated with increased smoking at home. METHODS: Logistic regressions were used to estimate the OR of a person living with a 100% smokefree-home rule as a function of individual characteristics, household composition, and whether or not the residential region is covered by clean indoor air laws. The data came from successive waves of the Tobacco Use Supplement to Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) for the years 1992-2007, and the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation database of state and local government clean indoor air laws. Analysis was conducted in 2010 and 2011. RESULTS: Living in a county fully covered by a 100% clean indoor air law in workplaces or restaurants or bars is associated with an increased likelihood of having a voluntary 100% smokefree-home rule both for people living with smokers (OR=7.76, 95% CI=5.27, 11.43) and not living with smokers (OR=4.12, 95% CI=3.28, 5.16). CONCLUSIONS: Strong clean indoor air laws are associated with large increases in voluntary smokefree-home policies both in the homes with and without smokers. These results support the hypothesis of norm spreading of clean indoor air laws.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099232?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222862">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> California, Female, Health Surveys, Housing, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Motivation, prevention & control, Regression Analysis, Smoking, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, </td></tr><tr><td> Clark PI, Schooley MW, Pierce B, Schulman J, Hartman AM, Schmitt CL, </td><td> <strong>Impact of home smoking rules on smoking patterns among adolescents and young adults.</strong> <br> Clark PI, Schooley MW, Pierce B, Schulman J, Hartman AM, Schmitt CL, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2006 Apr <br> Preventing chronic disease 3 (2) :A41 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal34">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal34" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Impact of home smoking rules on smoking patterns among adolescents and young adults.</strong> <br> Clark PI, Schooley MW, Pierce B, Schulman J, Hartman AM, Schmitt CL, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2006 Apr <br><p>INTRODUCTION: Smoking restrictions in public places have been shown to reduce cigarette consumption and may reduce smoking prevalence. Evidence is emerging that smoke-free policies in nonpublic places may have a similar effect. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an association exists between household smoking rules and smoking patterns among adolescents (aged 15 to 18 years) and young adults (aged 19 to 24 years) living in parental homes (i.e., the homes of their parents, grandparents, or foster parents). METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the 1998-1999 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey were analyzed for the association between household smoking rules and smoking behaviors among adolescents and young adults. We used a probability sample of noninstitutionalized adolescents (aged 15 to 18 years) and young adults (aged 19 to 24 years) living in the United States and assessed smoking status, attempts to quit, and smoking intensity. RESULTS: After controlling for smoking status of others in the household, the odds of ever having smoked, being a current smoker, and smoking more than five cigarettes per day were significantly smaller in households with strict no-smoking policies than in households where smoking was permitted anywhere. These results were relevant for adolescents and young adults. CONCLUSION: Household smoking rules are a type of antitobacco socialization that help deter adolescents from smoking. The influence of household smoking rules seems to extend beyond adolescence into the young adult years among people who continue to live at home with their parents, grandparents, or foster parents.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16539782?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1563982">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Data Collection, epidemiology, ethnology, Family, Humans, psychology, Residence Characteristics, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Cokkinides V, Bandi P, McMahon C, Jemal A, Glynn T, Ward E, </td><td> <strong>Tobacco control in the United States--recent progress and opportunities.</strong> <br> Cokkinides V, Bandi P, McMahon C, Jemal A, Glynn T, Ward E, <br> Journal Article Review <br> 2009 Nov-Dec <br> CA: a cancer journal for clinicians 59 (6) :352-65 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal35">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal35" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Tobacco control in the United States--recent progress and opportunities.</strong> <br> Cokkinides V, Bandi P, McMahon C, Jemal A, Glynn T, Ward E, <br> Journal Article Review <br> 2009 Nov-Dec <br><p>Effective tobacco control efforts have resulted in substantial declines in tobacco use and tobacco-related cancer deaths in the United States. Nearly 40% of reductions in male lung cancer deaths between 1991 and 2003 can be attributed to smoking declines in the last half century. Nevertheless, tobacco use still remains the single, largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United States. Each year, smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke result in nearly half a million premature deaths of which nearly one-third are due to cancer. In a previous report, we described youth and adult smoking prevalence and patterns and discussed policy measures that had proven effective in comprehensive tobacco control. In this report, we update trends in youth and adult smoking prevalence. We find that while adult smoking prevalence has declined overall, socioeconomic gradients in smoking still persist within race and ethnic subgroups. In addition, we describe the diffusion of tobacco-control strategies at the national, state, and community level. Although recent developments, such as the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulation of tobacco products, hold promise for tobacco control, there continues to be a need for broader dissemination of sustainably funded comprehensive national and state tobacco-control programs.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897839?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, adverse effects, epidemiology, etiology, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Neoplasms, prevention & control, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Socioeconomic Factors, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Cummings KM, Shah D,, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</td><td> <strong>Trends in smoking initiation among adolescents and young adults--United States, 1980-1989.</strong> <br> Cummings KM, Shah D,, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <br> Journal Article <br> 1995 Jul 21 <br> MMWR.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, National Survey on Drug Use and Health, National Health Interview Survey, and Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey collect data on current cigarette type preference and primary measures of dependence, and thus allow examination of whether menthol smokers are more dependent than non-menthol smokers. Analyses based on combined data from multiple administrations of each of these four nationally representative surveys, using three definitions for current smokers (i.e., smoked ⩾1day, ⩾10days and daily during the past month), consistently demonstrate that menthol smokers do not report smoking more cigarettes per day than non-menthol smokers. Moreover, two of the three surveys that provide data on time to first cigarette after waking indicate no difference in urgency to smoke among menthol compared to non-menthol smokers, while the third suggests menthol smokers may experience a greater urgency to smoke; estimates from all three surveys indicate that menthol versus non-menthol smokers do not report a higher Heaviness of Smoking Index. Collectively, these findings indicate no difference in dependence among U.S. smokers who use menthol compared to non-menthol cigarettes.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852490?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Davis WW, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, </td><td> <strong>Trends in Smoking Prevalence by Race based on the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey</strong> <br> Davis WW, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, <br><br> 2007 <br><br> <br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal39">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal39" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Trends in Smoking Prevalence by Race based on the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey</strong> <br> Davis WW, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, <br><br> 2007  </div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> DeCicca P, Kenkel D, Mathios A, </td><td> <strong>Cigarette taxes and the transition from youth to adult smoking: smoking initiation, cessation, and participation.</strong> <br> DeCicca P, Kenkel D, Mathios A, <br> Journal Article <br> 2008 Jul <br> Journal of health economics 27 (4) :904-17 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal40">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal40" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Cigarette taxes and the transition from youth to adult smoking: smoking initiation, cessation, and participation.</strong> <br> DeCicca P, Kenkel D, Mathios A, <br> Journal Article <br> 2008 Jul <br><p>Many policy makers continue to advocate and adopt cigarette taxes as a public health measure. Most previous individual-level empirical studies of cigarette demand are essentially static analyses of the relationship between the level of taxes and smoking behavior at a point in time. In this study, we use longitudinal data to examine the dynamics of young adults' decisions about smoking initiation and cessation. We develop a simple model to highlight the distinctions between smoking initiation, cessation, and participation. We show that because smoking participation reflects past decisions regarding initiation and cessation, the price elasticity of smoking participation is a weighted average of corresponding initiation and cessation elasticities, a finding that applies more broadly to other addictive substances as well. The paper's remaining contributions are empirical. We use data from the 1992 wave of the National Education Longitudinal Study, when most of the cohort were high school seniors, and data from the 2000 wave, when they were about 26 years old. The results show that the distinction between initiation and cessation is empirically useful. We also contribute new estimates on the tax-responsiveness of young adult smoking, paying careful attention to the possibility of bias if hard-to-observe differences in anti-smoking sentiment are correlated with state cigarette taxes. We find no evidence that higher taxes prevent smoking initiation, but some evidence that higher taxes are associated with increased cessation.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18513811?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Guidance & Policy Research, Monitoring Risk Factors, Policy, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Longitudinal/Cohort Studies, Tobacco - Modeling, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, economics, epidemiology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Taxes, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Decicca P, Kenkel D, Mathios A, Shin YJ, Lim JY, </td><td> <strong>Youth smoking, cigarette prices, and anti-smoking sentiment.</strong> <br> Decicca P, Kenkel D, Mathios A, Shin YJ, Lim JY, <br> Journal Article <br> 2008 Jun <br> Health economics 17 (6) :733-49 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal41">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal41" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Youth smoking, cigarette prices, and anti-smoking sentiment.</strong> <br> Decicca P, Kenkel D, Mathios A, Shin YJ, Lim JY, <br> Journal Article <br> 2008 Jun <br><p>In this paper, we develop a new direct measure of state anti-smoking sentiment and merge it with micro-data on youth smoking in 1992 and 2000.

METHODS: We summarize and expand on the recommendations from the Host Working Group of the National Tobacco Monitoring, Research and Evaluation Workshop. We also discuss research challenges and make additional recommendations for improving tobacco control surveillance and evaluation. RESULTS: We reviewed 10 major US surveys that collect data on tobacco use. A great deal of data is collected but gaps exist. Data collection on cigars, smokeless tobacco, brand, menthols, and PREPs is sparse and infrequent. Also, a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in US population composition, declines in survey response rates, and increases in cell phone use present research challenges that may impact the ongoing utility of these systems. CONCLUSIONS: Although the field of tobacco control research is an advanced area of public health, improvements in data systems are necessary to accurately evaluate progress and continue tobacco control gains. A coordinated surveillance and evaluation network would increase efficiency and improve the overall utility, quality and timeliness of the current data systems.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18851990?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Epidemiologic, Experimental, & Methodological Studies, Health Behaviors & Survivorship, Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Attitude to Health, Bias (Epidemiology), Data Collection, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Education, epidemiology, Health Behavior, Health Surveys, Humans, methods, Population Surveillance, Public Health Practice, Questionnaires, Smoking, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Delnevo CD, Gundersen DA, Hrywna M, Echeverria SE, Steinberg MB, </td><td> <strong>Smoking-cessation prevalence among US smokers of menthol versus non-menthol cigarettes</strong> <br> Delnevo CD, Gundersen DA, Hrywna M, Echeverria SE, Steinberg MB, <br><br> 2011 <br> American Journal of Preventive Medicine : <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal43">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal43" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Smoking-cessation prevalence among US smokers of menthol versus non-menthol cigarettes</strong> <br> Delnevo CD, Gundersen DA, Hrywna M, Echeverria SE, Steinberg MB, <br><br> 2011 <br><p>BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration currently is assessing the public health impact of menthol cigarettes. Whether menthol cigarettes pose increased barriers to quitting is a critical issue because previous declines in smoking prevalence have stalled. PURPOSE: To explore whether menthol cigarette smokers are less likely to quit than non-menthol smokers at the population level and whether this relationship differs by race/ethnicity. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of the 2003 and 2006/2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey were conducted in 2010. Multiple logistic regressions were used to calculate the adjusted odds of cessation for menthol smoking relative to non-menthol smoking. Five different sample restrictions were used to assess the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: In the broadest sample restriction, menthol smokers were less likely to have quit smoking (AOR=0.91, 95% CI=0.87, 0.96). This relationship holds among whites (AOR=0.93, 95% CI=0.88, 0.98) and blacks (AOR=0.81, 95% CI=0.67, 0.98). The magnitude of the relationship among Hispanics was similar to that among whites, but differed by Hispanic origin. Among those of Mexican origin, the AOR for menthol smokers was protective but not significant (AOR=1.29, 95% CI=0.99, 1.61), whereas among those of Puerto Rican origin, menthol smokers were less likely to have quit (AOR=0.57, 95% CI=0.37, 0.87). These findings were robust and significant in four of five sample restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking menthol cigarettes is associated with decreased cessation at the population level, and this association is more pronounced among black and Puerto Rican smokers. These findings support the recent calls to ban menthol flavoring in cigarettes.</p><a href="" target="_blank">Visit this publication's Web page</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Delnevo CD, Steinberg MB, Hudson SV, Ulpe R, Dipaola RS, </td><td> <strong>Epidemiology of Cigarette and Smokeless Tobacco Use among South Asian Immigrants in the Northeastern United States.</strong> <br> Delnevo CD, Steinberg MB, Hudson SV, Ulpe R, Dipaola RS, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 <br> Journal of oncology 2011 :252675 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal44">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal44" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Epidemiology of Cigarette and Smokeless Tobacco Use among South Asian Immigrants in the Northeastern United States.</strong> <br> Delnevo CD, Steinberg MB, Hudson SV, Ulpe R, Dipaola RS, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 <br><p>As the most preventable cause of death in the world today, understanding tobacco use among one of the fastest growing ethnic/racial groups is warranted.

Cross sectional survey data are employed from the February 2002 panel of the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey (54,024 individuals representing the US population aged 15-80). Non-linear relationships between both outcome variables and the predictors were modeled. Independent associations of strong clean indoor air laws were found for current smoker status (OR 0.66), and consumption among current smokers (-2.36 cigarettes/day). Cigarette price was found to have independent associations with both outcomes, an effect that saturated at higher prices. The odds ratio for smoking for the highest versus lowest price over the range where there was a price effect was 0.83. Average consumption declined (-1.16 cigarettes/day) over the range of effect of price on consumption. Neither policy varied in its effect by educational attainment, or household income. The association of cigarette price with reduced smoking participation and consumption was not found to vary with race/ethnicity. Population vulnerability in consumption appears to be structured by non-white race categories, but not at the state and county levels at which the policies we studied were enacted. Clean indoor air laws and price increases appear to benefit all socio-economic and race/ethnic groups in our study equally in terms of reducing smoking participation and consumption.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19282078?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748432">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Economics of Cancer, Health Disparities, Monitoring Risk Factors, Policy, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Modeling, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Program Evaluation, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Air Pollution, Indoor, Cross-Sectional Studies, economics, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, Female, Health Policy, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, Public Health, Smoking, State Government, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Elliott Michael R, Davis William W, </td><td> <strong>Obtaining cancer risk factor prevalence estimates in small areas: combining data from two surveys</strong> <br> Elliott Michael R, Davis William W, <br><br> Jun 2005 <br> Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics) 54 :595-609 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal47">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal47" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Obtaining cancer risk factor prevalence estimates in small areas: combining data from two surveys</strong> <br> Elliott Michael R, Davis William W, <br><br> Jun 2005 <br><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.05459.x" target="_blank">Visit this publication's Web page</a></div></div></div></td><td> Methods for Assessing Risk Factors, Tobacco, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Emery S, Kim Y, Choi YK, Szczypka G, Wakefield M, Chaloupka FJ, </td><td> <strong>The effects of smoking-related television advertising on smoking and intentions to quit among adults in the United States: 1999-2007.</strong> <br> Emery S, Kim Y, Choi YK, Szczypka G, Wakefield M, Chaloupka FJ, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2012 Apr <br> American journal of public health 102 (4) :751-7 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal48">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal48" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The effects of smoking-related television advertising on smoking and intentions to quit among adults in the United States: 1999-2007.</strong> <br> Emery S, Kim Y, Choi YK, Szczypka G, Wakefield M, Chaloupka FJ, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2012 Apr <br><p>OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether state-sponsored antitobacco advertisements are associated with reduced adult smoking, and interactions between smoking-related advertising types. METHODS: We measured mean exposure to smoking-related advertisements with television ratings for the top-75 US media markets from 1999 to 2007. We combined these data with individual-level Current Population Surveys Tobacco Use Supplement data and state tobacco control policy data. RESULTS: Higher exposure to state-sponsored, Legacy, and pharmaceutical advertisements was associated with less smoking; higher exposure to tobacco industry advertisements was associated with more smoking. Higher exposure to state- and Legacy-sponsored advertisements was positively associated with intentions to quit and having made a past-year quit attempt; higher exposure to ads for pharmaceutical cessation aids was negatively associated with having made a quit attempt. There was a significant negative interaction between state- and Legacy-sponsored advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to state-sponsored advertisements was far below Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended best practices. The significant negative relationships between antismoking advertising and adult smoking provide strong evidence that tobacco-control media campaigns help reduce adult smoking. The significant negative interaction between state- and Legacy-sponsored advertising suggests that the campaigns reinforce one another.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22397350?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489369">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adult, Advertising as Topic, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, Health Promotion, Humans, Intention, Logistic Models, prevention & control, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Television, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Etter JF, </td><td> <strong>Associations between smoking prevalence, stages of change, cigarette consumption, and quit attempts across the United States.</strong> <br> Etter JF, <br> Journal Article <br> 2004 Mar <br> Preventive medicine 38 (3) :369-73 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal49">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal49" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Associations between smoking prevalence, stages of change, cigarette consumption, and quit attempts across the United States.</strong> <br> Etter JF, <br> Journal Article <br> 2004 Mar <br><p>BACKGROUND: We tested whether across the 50 U.S. States, smoking prevalence was associated with smoking behavior among smokers. METHODS: We used published data on smoking prevalence, cigarette consumption, and quit attempts by State from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 1993, 1996, and 1999, and published data on the distribution of smokers by stage of change in each State from the Current Population Survey (CPS).

METHODS: Data from the national 2003 Tobacco Use Special Cessation Supplement to the Current Population Survey were analyzed to identify factors associated with quit attempts and serious intention to quit among young adult smokers aged 18 to 30 years (n=7912). RESULTS: Daily smokers who smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day, had their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking, and smoked no usual type were less likely than were their comparison groups to have 1 more or quit attempts. Nondaily smokers who were male, Hispanic, and smoked no usual type of cigarette were also less likely than were their comparison groups to report 1 or more quit attempts. Although unemployed nondaily smokers were more likely than were the employed to report intention to quit, nondaily smokers with an annual family income of $25,000 to $49,000 were less likely than were higher-income families to report intention to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine dependence measures were significantly associated with quitting and intention to quit among daily smokers, but sociodemographics were associated with quitting and intention to quit among nondaily smokers.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17600244?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931471">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, ethnology, Female, Health Behavior, Humans, Intention, Logistic Models, Male, Multivariate Analysis, Prevalence, prevention & control, psychology, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Fagan P, Moolchan ET, Hart A Jr, Rose A, Lawrence D, Shavers VL, Gibson JT, </td><td> <strong>Nicotine dependence and quitting behaviors among menthol and non-menthol smokers with similar consumptive patterns.</strong> <br> Fagan P, Moolchan ET, Hart A Jr, Rose A, Lawrence D, Shavers VL, Gibson JT, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Dec <br> Addiction (Abingdon, England) 105 Suppl 1 :55-74 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal51">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal51" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Nicotine dependence and quitting behaviors among menthol and non-menthol smokers with similar consumptive patterns.</strong> <br> Fagan P, Moolchan ET, Hart A Jr, Rose A, Lawrence D, Shavers VL, Gibson JT, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Dec <br><p>AIMS: This study examines the associations between usual cigarette brand (i.e. menthol, non-menthol) and markers for nicotine dependence and quitting behaviors. DESIGN: The 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys were pooled to conduct secondary data analysis. SETTING: National data were collected using in-person and telephone computer-assisted interviews by the United States Census Bureau among civilian, non-institutionalized people aged 15 years and older. PARTICIPANTS: Data were analyzed among daily current smokers aged 18+ (n=46,273). MEASUREMENTS: The associations between usual cigarette brand and time to first cigarette within 5 and 30 minutes after waking, quit attempts in the past 12 months and length of smoking abstinence in the past 12 months were examined. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were stratified by smoking intensity: ≤5, 6-10, 11-19 and 20+ cigarettes per day. FINDINGS: Menthol smokers reported a mean of 13.05 compared with 15.01 cigarettes per day among non-menthol smokers (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate results showed that among smokers consuming 6-10 cigarettes per day, menthol smokers were significantly more likely than non-menthol smokers to consume their first cigarette within 5 minutes after waking (odds ratio=1.22, 95% confidence interval=1.05,1.43). The multivariate models did not show significant associations between usual cigarette brand and quit attempts in past 12 months or duration of smoking abstinence >2 weeks in the past 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this national survey of daily smokers demonstrate that menthol smokers in the United States who report consuming 6-10 cigarettes per day show greater signs of nicotine dependence than comparable non-menthol smokers.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059137?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Attitude to Health, Epidemiologic Methods, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, Female, Humans, Male, Menthol, Middle Aged, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, Time Factors, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Fagan P, Shavers V, Lawrence D, Gibson JT, Ponder P, </td><td> <strong>Cigarette smoking and quitting behaviors among unemployed adults in the United States.</strong> <br> Fagan P, Shavers V, Lawrence D, Gibson JT, Ponder P, <br> Journal Article <br> 2007 Feb <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 9 (2) :241-8 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal52">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal52" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Cigarette smoking and quitting behaviors among unemployed adults in the United States.</strong> <br> Fagan P, Shavers V, Lawrence D, Gibson JT, Ponder P, <br> Journal Article <br> 2007 Feb <br><p>Little is known about factors associated with smoking among the unemployed. This study estimated the prevalence of smoking and examined sociodemographic factors associated with current, former, and successful quitting among unemployed adults aged 18-64. Cross-sectional data on 13,480 participants in the 1998-1999 and 2001-2002 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine factors associated with study outcomes (current vs. never, former vs. current, successful quitter vs. other former smoker). Among the unemployed, 35% were current smokers and 13% were former smokers. Of the former smokers, 81% quit successfully for at least 12 months. Participants with family incomes of less than US$25,000 were more likely than those with incomes of $50,000 or more to currently smoke (OR=2.13, 95% CI=1.85-2.46). Service workers and blue-collar workers were less likely than white-collar workers to report former smoking. Participants unemployed for 6 months or more were twice as likely as those unemployed for less than 6 months to quit successfully (OR=2.05, 95% CI=1.07-3.95). Unemployed blue-collar workers had a greater odds ratio of successfully quitting than white-collar workers (OR=1.83, 95% CI=1.17-2.87). Smoking rates were high among the unemployed, and quitting behaviors varied by sociodemographic factors and length of unemployment.

METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the associations among the variables using cross-sectional data from the 1998-1999 and 2001-2002 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. RESULTS: Lower odds of current smoking was observed among part-time workers compared to those working variable hours and multiple job holders compared to persons holding one job. The self-employed, part-time workers and multiple job holders had higher odds of former smoking than comparison groups. Employment factors were not associated with short-term abstinence or 12-month abstinence from smoking, but income, education, marital status, and duration of smoking were associated with 12-month abstinence.

METHODS: We analyzed a cross-sectional sample of 4,502 adolescents, ages 15-17 years, who lived in two-parent households that were interviewed as part of the 1992-1993 Tobacco Supplement of the Current Population Survey, which questioned householders 15 years of age and older about their smoking history. Ever smokers reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Former smokers were ever smokers who had quit. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses, adjusted for demographic characteristics of adolescents, as well as father's age, education, and family income, found that adolescents whose parents had quit smoking were almost one-third less likely to be ever smokers than those with a parent who still smoked. Furthermore, adolescent ever smokers whose parents quit smoking were twice as likely to quit as those who had a parent who still smoked. Parental quitting is most effective in reducing initiation if it occurs before the child reaches 9 years of age. CONCLUSION: Encouraging parents to quit may be an effective method for reducing adolescent smoking, through decreased uptake and increased cessation. The earlier parents quit, the less likely their children will become smokers.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10072737?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Cross-Sectional Studies, Educational Status, epidemiology, Female, Health Behavior, Health Surveys, Humans, Income, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Parents, prevention & control, psychology, Psychology, Adolescent, Questionnaires, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Farkas AJ, Gilpin EA, Distefan JM, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>The effects of household and workplace smoking restrictions on quitting behaviours.</strong> <br> Farkas AJ, Gilpin EA, Distefan JM, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1999 Autumn <br> Tobacco control 8 (3) :261-5 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal55">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal55" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The effects of household and workplace smoking restrictions on quitting behaviours.</strong> <br> Farkas AJ, Gilpin EA, Distefan JM, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1999 Autumn <br><p>OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of household and workplace smoking restrictions with quit attempts, six month cessation, and light smoking. DESIGN: Logistic regressions identified the association of household and workplace smoking restrictions with attempts to quit, six month cessation, and light smoking. SETTING: Large population surveys, United States. SUBJECTS: Respondents (n=48,584) smoked during the year before interview in 1992-1993, lived with at least one other person, and were either current daily smokers or were former smokers when interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were an attempt to quit during the last 12 months, cessation for at least six months among those who made an attempt to quit, and light smoking (&lt; 15 cigarettes a day). RESULTS: Smokers who lived (odds ratio (OR)=3.86; 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.57 to 4.18) or worked (OR=1.14; 95% CI=1.05 to 1.24) under a total smoking ban were more likely to report a quit attempt in the previous year. Among those who made an attempt, those who lived (OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.43 to 1.91) or worked (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.003 to 1.45) under a total smoking ban were more likely to be in cessation for at least six months. Current daily smokers who lived (OR=2.73, 95% CI=2.46 to 3.04) or worked (OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.38 to 1.70) under a total smoking ban were more likely to be light smokers.

Whether workplace and home smoking restrictions play a role in such prevention is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between workplace and home smoking restrictions and adolescent smoking. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: Data were analyzed from 2 large national population-based surveys, the Current Population Surveys of 1992-1993 and 1995-1996, which included 17,185 adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking status of the adolescents surveyed, compared by presence of home and workplace smoking restrictions. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographics and other smokers in the household, adolescents who lived in smoke-free households were 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-88%) as likely to be smokers as adolescents who lived in households with no smoking restrictions. Similarly, adolescents who worked in smoke-free workplaces were 68% (95% CI, 51%-90%) as likely to be smokers as adolescents who worked in a workplace with no smoking restrictions. Adolescent smokers were 1.80 (95% CI, 1.23-2.65) times more likely to be former smokers if they lived in smoke-free homes. The most marked relationship of home smoking restrictions to current adolescent smoking occurred in households where all other members were never-smokers. Current smoking prevalence among adolescents in homes without smoking restrictions approached that among adolescents in homes with a current smoker but with smoking restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Parents with minor children should be encouraged to adopt smoke-free homes. Smoke-free workplaces can also augment smoking prevention. These findings emphasize the importance of tobacco control strategies aimed at the entire population rather than at youth alone.

DESIGN: Analysis of data from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) collected from 1995 to 2006 and the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) collected from 1999 to 2006. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults 25 years or older who completed the TUS-CPS and youth in middle and high school who completed the NYTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Current smoking among middle and high school students as a function of the change in state-level adult smoking, controlling for individual-level sociodemographic characteristics and state-level tobacco control policy variables. RESULTS: Among middle school students, declines in state-level adult smoking rates are associated with lower odds of current smoking (P &lt; .05), and each doubling of the decline in adult smoking rates is associated with a 6.0% decrease in youth smoking. Among high school students, declines in state-level adult smoking rates are not associated with current smoking. Higher cigarette prices were associated with lower odds of smoking among middle and high school students. Greater population coverage by smoke-free air laws and greater funding for tobacco control programs were associated with lower odds of current smoking among high school students but not middle school students. Compliance with youth access laws was not associated with middle or high school smoking. CONCLUSION: By quantifying the effect of changes in state-level adult smoking rates on youth smoking, this study enhances the precision with which the tobacco control community can assess the return on investment for adult-focused tobacco control programs.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23760306?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Modeling, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Farrelly MC, Evans WN, Sfekas AE, </td><td> <strong>The impact of workplace smoking bans: results from a national survey.</strong> <br> Farrelly MC, Evans WN, Sfekas AE, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1999 Autumn <br> Tobacco control 8 (3) :272-7 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal58">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal58" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The impact of workplace smoking bans: results from a national survey.</strong> <br> Farrelly MC, Evans WN, Sfekas AE, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1999 Autumn <br><p>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of workplace smoking restrictions on the prevalence and intensity of smoking among all indoor workers and various demographic and industry groups. DESIGN: Detailed cross sectional data on worker self reported characteristics, smoking histories, and workplace smoking policies were used in multivariate statistical models to examine whether workplace smoking policies reduce cigarette consumption. After analysing the distribution of policies, four main types of workplace programme were defined: (1) 100% smoke-free environments, (2) work area bans in which smoking is allowed in some common areas, (3) bans in some but not all work and common areas, and (4) minimal or no restrictions. SETTING: After environmental tobacco smoke was identified as a health hazard in the mid-1980s, workplace smoking restrictions became more prevalent. By 1993, nearly 82% of indoor workers faced some restriction on workplace smoking and 47% worked in 100% smoke-free environments. PARTICIPANTS: The database included a nationally representative sample from the tobacco use supplements to the September 1992, January 1993, and May 1993 Current Population Surveys of 97,882 indoor workers who were not self employed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked daily by smokers. RESULTS: Having a 100% smoke-free workplace reduced smoking prevalence by 6 percentage points and average daily consumption among smokers by 14% relative to workers subject to minimal or no restrictions. The impact of work area bans was lessened by allowing smoking in some common areas. Smoke-free policies reduced smoking for all demographic groups and in nearly all industries. CONCLUSIONS: Requiring all workplaces to be smoke free would reduce smoking prevalence by 10%. Workplace bans have their greatest impact on groups with the highest rates of smoking.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10599571?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1763942">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, Female, Health Promotion, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, prevention & control, Questionnaires, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Farrelly MC, Pechacek TF, Thomas KY, Nelson D, </td><td> <strong>The impact of tobacco control programs on adult smoking.</strong> <br> Farrelly MC, Pechacek TF, Thomas KY, Nelson D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2008 Feb <br> American journal of public health 98 (2) :304-9 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal59">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal59" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The impact of tobacco control programs on adult smoking.</strong> <br> Farrelly MC, Pechacek TF, Thomas KY, Nelson D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2008 Feb <br><p>OBJECTIVES: We examined whether state tobacco control programs are effective in reducing the prevalence of adult smoking. METHODS: We used state survey data on smoking from 1985 to 2003 in a quasi-experimental design to examine the association between cumulative state antitobacco program expenditures and changes in adult smoking prevalence, after we controlled for confounding. RESULTS: From 1985 to 2003, national adult smoking prevalence declined from 29.5% to 18.6% (P&lt;.001). Increases in state per capita tobacco control program expenditures were independently associated with declines in prevalence. Program expenditures were more effective in reducing smoking prevalence among adults aged 25 or older than for adults aged 18 to 24 years, whereas cigarette prices had a stronger effect on adults aged 18 to 24 years. If, starting in 1995, all states had funded their tobacco control programs at the minimum or optimal levels recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there would have been 2.2 million to 7.1 million fewer smokers by 2003.

It was found that by 1999, smokefree workplaces were widely accepted by two-thirds of adults, with half favoring completely smokefree restaurants. Completely smokefree bars remained less popular, with nearly equal numbers (about 30%) preferring them or favoring unrestricted bar smoking. Even among bar and restaurant industry workers less than 10% favored unrestricted restaurant smoking. Greater acceptances of smokefree bars are now taking hold, especially in places like California, where acceptance rose 15% in six years, and 45% preferred them.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis was conducted using logistic regression of cross-sectional data. SETTING: The 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS) to the Current Population Survey, administered by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Census Bureau, formed the basis for this investigation. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 66,145 current smokers who participated in the TUS CPS administrations in 2003 and 2006/07. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, income), smoking frequency, menthol cigarette use, status of smoking bans in the work-place and at home, availability of cessation services at work and knowledge of quitting resources were assessed. FINDINGS: Among all current smokers with an indoor job, with no smoke-free restrictions at either work or home as the reference, those who smoked menthol cigarettes were about one-third as likely to have a smoke-free policy at both work and home [odds ratio (OR)=0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27-0.38]. In the comparison of those with an indoor smoke-free policy at work only versus those with no restrictions, menthol status was a risk factor for not having a work-place restriction (OR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.67-0.93); similarly, within this sample, menthol use was a risk factor for not having a home restriction (OR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.31-0.46). Among all current smokers, the use of menthol cigarettes was a risk factor for not having a smoking restriction at home (OR=0.93; 95% CI: 0.88-0.98). Menthol smoking was not related to availability of cessation services offered at work or knowledge of cessation services. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that menthol smoking is associated with lack of policy protection from second-hand smoke exposure. Policymakers and tobacco control professionals should monitor tobacco control efforts to ensure that policies and interventions reach all menthol smokers.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059141?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, adverse effects, Aged, Demography, Epidemiologic Methods, epidemiology, Female, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, Menthol, Middle Aged, Occupational Health Services, Organizational Policy, prevention & control, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, supply & distribution, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, Workplace, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Fernander A, Rayens MK, Zhang M, Adkins S, </td><td> <strong>Are age of smoking initiation and purchasing patterns associated with menthol smoking?</strong> <br> Fernander A, Rayens MK, Zhang M, Adkins S, <br> Journal Article <br> 2010 Dec <br> Addiction (Abingdon, England) 105 Suppl 1 :39-45 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal63">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal63" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Are age of smoking initiation and purchasing patterns associated with menthol smoking?</strong> <br> Fernander A, Rayens MK, Zhang M, Adkins S, <br> Journal Article <br> 2010 Dec <br><p>AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between age of cigarette smoking initiation and cigarette purchasing patterns on menthol smoking among current smokers. DESIGN: Secondary analyses were conducted using logistic regression with balanced replicated weights. SETTING: Data from the 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS) to the Current Population Survey (CPS), collected by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Census Bureau, formed the basis for this investigation. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 66,145 current smokers who participated in the TUS CPS administration in 2003 and 2006/07 were examined. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age, education and income), smoking frequency, purchase type (pack, carton, or both), age of initiation and menthol cigarette use were assessed. FINDINGS: One-quarter of the sample smoked menthol cigarettes; most purchased their cigarettes by the pack when rather than by the carton; average age of cigarette smoking initiation was 18 years; and females, ethnic/racial minorities and younger participants were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes compared with males, whites or older respondents. Other demographic factors associated with menthol cigarette use among current smokers included a high school education (the prevalence of menthol use among this cohort was greater than either those with less education or those with more). The multivariate logistic model only marginally revealed that age of smoking initiation predicted menthol smoking: findings are suggestive that the longer the delay of initiation the more likely that an individual smoked menthol cigarettes [odds ratio (OR)=1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.01]. In addition, relative to those who purchased cigarettes by the pack, smokers who purchased cigarettes by the carton were less (OR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.81-0.91) likely to be menthol smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Menthol smokers in the United States are more likely to be female, younger, from ethnic minority groups, and to have a high school education. The findings that menthol smokers in the U.S. tend to start smoking later than smokers of other types of cigarettes are suggestive only and require further study.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059135?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, African Americans, Age Factors, Age of Onset, Aged, epidemiology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Menthol, Middle Aged, Population Surveillance, Product Packaging, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Gerlach KK, Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Pechacek TF, </td><td> <strong>Workplace smoking policies in the United States: results from a national survey of more than 100,000 workers.</strong> <br> Gerlach KK, Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Pechacek TF, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article <br> 1997 Autumn <br> Tobacco control 6 (3) :199-206 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal64">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal64" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Workplace smoking policies in the United States: results from a national survey of more than 100,000 workers.</strong> <br> Gerlach KK, Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Pechacek TF, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article <br> 1997 Autumn <br><p>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of smoking policies in indoor work environments as reported by a nationally representative sample of workers in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of households within the United States. SETTING: All 50 state and the District of Columbia, 1992-93. PARTICIPANTS: Currently employed indoor workers 15 years of age and older who responded to the National Cancer Institute's Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (n=100,561). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence and restrictiveness of workplace smoking policies as reported by workers currently employed in indoor workplaces in the United States. RESULTS: Most of the indoor workers surveyed (81.6%) reported that their place of work had an official policy that addressed smoking in the workplace; 46.0% reported that their workplace policy did not permit smoking in either the public/common areas--for example, restrooms and cafeterias--or the work areas of the workplace. The reporting of these "smoke-free" policies varied significantly by gender, age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and occupation of the worker. CONCLUSIONS: Although nearly half of all indoor workers in this survey reported that they had a smoke-free policy in their workplace, significant numbers of workers, especially those in blue-collar and service occupations, reported smoke-free rates well below the national average. If implemented, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration's proposed regulation to require worksites to be smoke-free has the potential to increase significantly the percentage of American workers covered by these policies and to eliminate most of the disparity currently found across occupational groups.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9396104?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1759575">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Guidance & Policy Research, Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Age Distribution, epidemiology, Female, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, Middle Aged, prevention & control, Questionnaires, Sex Distribution, Smoking, United States, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Gilpin EA, Choi WS, Berry C, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>How many adolescents start smoking each day in the United States?</strong> <br> Gilpin EA, Choi WS, Berry C, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1999 Oct <br> The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine 25 (4) :248-55 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal65">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal65" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>How many adolescents start smoking each day in the United States?</strong> <br> Gilpin EA, Choi WS, Berry C, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1999 Oct <br><p>PURPOSE: To provide daily estimates of first experimentation and attainment of established smoking in adolescents 11-17 years of age. METHODS: The 1989 and 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices Surveys (TAPS) (16,954 observations) was used to estimate rates in 1991 for: (a) first experimentation (even a few puffs), and (b) established smoking (reaching a lifetime level of at least 100 cigarettes). The 1992 and 1993 Current Population Surveys (CPS) (82,279 adults) allowed calculation of year-specific initiation rates (1980-1989) from the age respondents reported as having started smoking "fairly regularly." Rates were applied to Census data for the appropriate years to yield numbers accruing each day. Estimates were calculated for adolescents (11- to 17-year-olds) and youth (11- to 20-year-olds). RESULTS: For TAPS, in 1991, 4824 adolescents first tried cigarettes and 1975 became established smokers each day. Considering all youth, these estimates increase to 5497/day for first experimentation and to 2933/day for established smokers. For CPS, from 1980 to 1989, around 2300 adolescents initiated fairly regular smoking each day. For all youth, the estimate has increased to about 3400/day. CONCLUSIONS: Because approximately 4800 adolescents and 5500 youth appear to be experimenting with cigarettes for the first time each day, and close to 3000 youth become established smokers daily, increased prevention efforts are clearly justified.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10505842?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Age Factors, Attitude, Child, epidemiology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Smoking, trends, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>Changes in population attitudes about where smoking should not be allowed: California versus the rest of the USA.</strong> <br> Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Mar <br> Tobacco control 13 (1) :38-44 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal66">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal66" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Changes in population attitudes about where smoking should not be allowed: California versus the rest of the USA.</strong> <br> Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Mar <br><p>BACKGROUND: The decade long California Tobacco Control Program is unique to the nation in its duration, emphasis, and level of funding. Programme emphasis is on changing social norms about smoking as a means to discourage smoking and thus reduce the harmful health effects of tobacco to the population. METHODS: Data from the 1992-93, 1995-96, and 1998-99 Tobacco Use Supplements to the national Current Population Survey (n > 175 000 each period) were used to examine changes in norms regarding where smoking should "not be allowed at all" in both California and in the rest of the USA. Venues queried were restaurants, hospitals, work areas, bars, indoor sports venues, and indoor shopping malls. RESULTS: There were substantial increases in the percentages of the adult population (18+ years) stating that smoking should not be allowed in the venues queried in California by 1998-99 compared to 1992-93; only modest increases were observed in the rest of the USA. In fact, for most venues, the percentages for the rest of the USA were lower in 1998-99 than in California in 1992-93. Further, the percentage increase over this period in respondents stating that smoking should not be allowed in four or more of the six venues was 30% in California and 23% in the rest of the USA. The most dramatic percentage increase in California occurred among current smokers (93%). CONCLUSIONS: A strong, comprehensive tobacco control programme such as California's can influence population norms, including those of smokers, with respect to where smoking should not be allowed.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14985593?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1747831">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Attitudes, </td><td></td><td> Adult, adverse effects, Attitude, California, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, prevention & control, Public Health, Smoking, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Gilpin EA, Stillman FA, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>Index for US state tobacco control initial outcomes.</strong> <br> Gilpin EA, Stillman FA, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2000 Oct 15 <br> American journal of epidemiology 152 (8) :727-38 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal67">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal67" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Index for US state tobacco control initial outcomes.</strong> <br> Gilpin EA, Stillman FA, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2000 Oct 15 <br><p>Public health tobacco control efforts have increasingly targeted communities in addition to individuals. Before population smoking decreases, effectiveness might be detected from initial outcomes reflecting these efforts, such as higher cigarette prices or more workplace and home smoking restrictions. Presumably, these initial outcomes will eventually influence smoking behavior. State-specific estimates of percentages of the population working or living under smoking bans are available from the 1992-1993 tobacco use supplement to the Current Population Survey, conducted annually by the US Bureau of the Census. In addition, the tobacco industry reports the average state cigarette price yearly. The authors constructed a tobacco control initial outcomes index (IOI) by using values of these variables for each state and correlated it with state-specific adult (aged > or=25 years) and youth (aged 15-24 years) smoking prevalence computed from the Current Population Survey and per capita cigarette consumption data computed from sales and Census Bureau data. Both adult smoking prevalence (r=-0.70) and per capita consumption (r=-0.73) were significantly correlated with the IOI; youth smoking prevalence correlated less well (r=-0.34). Although the analysis is not definitive, deseasonalized 1983-1997 consumption trends for IOI-based tertile groups were divergent beginning in 1993, with the high IOI group showing the greatest decrease. A high relative IOI index may be predictive of future smoking decreases and should be considered when tobacco control efforts are evaluated.</p><a

<br><p>BACKGROUND: Despite the high global burden of diseases caused by tobacco, valid and comparable prevalence data for patterns of adult tobacco use and factors influencing use are absent for many low-income and middle-income countries. We assess these patterns through analysis of data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS). METHODS: Between Oct 1, 2008, and March 15, 2010, GATS used nationally representative household surveys with comparable methods to obtain relevant information from individuals aged 15 years or older in 14 low-income and middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, and Vietnam). We compared weighted point estimates and 95% CIs of tobacco use between these 14 countries and with data from the 2008 UK General Lifestyle Survey and the 2006-07 US Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. All these surveys had cross-sectional study designs. FINDINGS: In countries participating in GATS, 48·6% (95% CI 47·6-49·6) of men and 11·3% (10·7-12·0) of women were tobacco users. 40·7% of men (ranging from 21·6% in Brazil to 60·2% in Russia) and 5·0% of women (0·5% in Egypt to 24·4% in Poland) in GATS countries smoked a tobacco product. Manufactured cigarettes were favoured by most smokers (82%) overall, but smokeless tobacco and bidis were commonly used in India and Bangladesh. For individuals who had ever smoked daily, women aged 55-64 years at the time of the survey began smoking at an older age than did equivalently aged men in most GATS countries. However, those individuals who had ever smoked daily and were aged 25-34-years when surveyed started to do so at much the same age in both sexes. Quit ratios were very low (&lt;20% overall) in China, India, Russia, Egypt, and Bangladesh. INTERPRETATION: The first wave of GATS showed high rates of smoking in men, early initiation of smoking in women, and low quit ratios, reinforcing the view that efforts to prevent initiation and promote cessation of tobacco use are needed to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: We gathered annual cigarette excise tax rates for all US states and the District of Columbia, between 1981 and 2011, and matched each state-year tax rate with economic, political, attitudinal, and demographic characteristics, creating a data set of 1581 observations. We used panel data regression techniques to assess relationships between key characteristics and state cigarette excise tax levels. RESULTS: Cigarette excise tax rates grew at more than 6 times the rate of inflation between 1981 and 2011; growth varied by time period and region. We found strong negative associations between Republican Party control of state legislatures and governors' offices and state cigarette tax rates. Tobacco production, citizens' attitudes toward taxes and tobacco control, and cigarette tax rates in neighboring states were significantly associated with cigarette tax rates. We found no association between unemployment and tax rates. CONCLUSIONS: Future excise tax growth rate may depend more on the political leanings of state legislators, and the attitudes of the people they represent, than on economic circumstances.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24328667?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3935682">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Policy, Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Attitude, economics, Humans, Politics, Residence Characteristics, Socioeconomic Factors, State Government, statistics & numerical data, Taxes, Tobacco Products, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Gower KB, Burns DM, Shanks TG, Vaughn JW, Anderson CM, Shopland DR, Hartman AM, </td><td> <strong>Section III.

METHODS: We used data from the 2003 Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey to analyze smoking behaviors among young adults aged 18-24 years and older young adults aged 25-34 years by college status (enrolled, or with a degree, but not enrolled) and other measures of socioeconomic position. RESULTS: Current smoking prevalence among US young adults aged 18-24 years who are not enrolled in college or who do not have a college degree was 30%. This was more than twice the current smoking prevalence among college-educated young adults (14%). Non-college-educated young adults were more likely than were college-educated young adults to start smoking at a younger age and were less likely to have made a quit attempt, although no differences were found in their intentions to quit. Higher rates of smoking in the non-college-educated population were also evident in the slightly older age group. CONCLUSIONS: Non-college-educated young adults smoke at more than twice the rate of their college-educated counterparts. Targeted prevention and cessation efforts are needed for non-college-educated young adults to prevent excess morbidity and mortality in later years.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17600242?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931459">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Educational Status, epidemiology, Female, Health Promotion, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, methods, Multivariate Analysis, Prevalence, prevention & control, psychology, Risk Factors, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Socioeconomic Factors, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Gundersen DA, Echeverria SE, Lewis MJ, Giovino GA, Ohman-Strickland P, Delnevo CD, </td><td> <strong>Heterogeneity in past year cigarette smoking quit attempts among Latinos.</strong> <br> Gundersen DA, Echeverria SE, Lewis MJ, Giovino GA, Ohman-Strickland P, Delnevo CD, <br> Journal Article <br> 2012 <br> Journal of environmental and public health 2012 :378165 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal74">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal74" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Heterogeneity in past year cigarette smoking quit attempts among Latinos.</strong> <br> Gundersen DA, Echeverria SE, Lewis MJ, Giovino GA, Ohman-Strickland P, Delnevo CD, <br> Journal Article <br> 2012 <br><p>OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between English language proficiency (ELP) and immigrant generation and having made a cigarette smoking quit attempt in the past 12 months among Latinos. Examine if gender moderates the association between acculturation and quit attempts. METHODS: Latino past year smokers from the 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between quit attempt and ELP and immigrant generation, controlling for demographics and smoking characteristics. RESULTS: Latinos with poor ELP were more likely to have made a quit attempt compared to those with good ELP (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.22, confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.46) after controlling for demographic and smoking characteristics. First (AOR=1.21, CI: 1.02-1.43) and second generation immigrants (AOR=1.36, CI: 1.12-1.64) were more likely than third generation immigrants to have made a quit attempt in the past 12 months. CONCLUSION: Quit behaviors are shaped by differences in language ability and generational status among Latinos.

RESULTS: The percent of indoor workers working under a smoke-free policy increased slightly, from 62% in 1995-1996 to 65% in 1998-1999. Respondents with a college degree were more likely to work under a smoke-free policy than those with a high school education or less. Among respondents with a work policy in 1998-1999, a complete ban on smoking reduced any workplace exposure in the past 2 weeks (4%) compared to a partial ban (26%) or an unrestricted policy (30%). CONCLUSION: Wisconsin has seen a small increase in workplace policies that ban smoking in the workplace.

METHODS: We analyzed data from the Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement surveys from 1992 through 2007. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic factors, blue-collar workers were at higher risk than white-collar workers for ever smoking, current smoking, and persistent smoking (current smoking among ever smokers). Construction workers were more likely to be current daily smokers than other blue-collar workers. Among ever smokers, current daily smoking was more common in the absence of both workplace rules against smoking and workplace smoking cessation programs. CONCLUSIONS: Social or cultural effects related to occupation are important determinants of smoking. More aggressive promotion of smoking cessation programs and workplace rules prohibiting smoking could have a significant public health impact.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21988795?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217081">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Data Collection, epidemiology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Organizational Policy, Smoking, United States, Workplace, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Harris JE, Chan SW, </td><td> <strong>The continuum-of-addiction: cigarette smoking in relation to price among Americans aged 15-29.</strong> <br> Harris JE, Chan SW, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 1999 Feb <br> Health economics 8 (1) :81-6 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal77">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal77" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The continuum-of-addiction: cigarette smoking in relation to price among Americans aged 15-29.</strong> <br> Harris JE, Chan SW, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 1999 Feb <br><p>We studied the relationship between current cigarette smoking and price among 34145 respondents, aged 15-29 years, to the 1992-1993 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey.

In response to higher prices, older youth were more likely to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day than to quit entirely. Among 15-17-year-olds, smoking cigarettes 'some days' was more sensitive to price than smoking 'every day'.

METHODS: We analyzed descriptive statistics and regression results using the 1998-1999 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement to determine the prevalence of SD smokers, their sociodemographic characteristics, and the smoking patterns and histories of groups differentiated by the length and stability of their SD smoking. RESULTS: SD smokers make up 19.2% of all current smokers. Among SD smokers, 44.6% have smoked less than daily for at least 1 year, no more than 14.4% are just starting to smoke, and the rest are likely in transition. Overall, SD smokers smoked a mean of 102 cigarettes per month (compared to 566.4 for daily smokers), on an average of 14.5 days out of the past 30. CONCLUSIONS: SD smokers make up a substantial segment of the smoking population. They are not just beginning to smoke nor trying to quit. Many have developed a long-standing pattern of nondaily smoking, smoking relatively few cigarettes on the days when they do smoke. They are not substantially younger than daily smokers, as one might expect.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12893622?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447964">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Behavior, Addictive, classification, Demography, epidemiology, Family Characteristics, Female, Forecasting, Health Behavior, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, psychology, Risk-Taking, Smoking, Social Environment, Time Factors, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Hawkins SS, Berkman L, </td><td> <strong>Parental home smoking policies: the protective effect of having a young child in the household.</strong> <br> Hawkins SS, Berkman L, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2011 Jul-Aug <br> Preventive medicine 53 (1-2) :61-3 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal79">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal79" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Parental home smoking policies: the protective effect of having a young child in the household.</strong> <br> Hawkins SS, Berkman L, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2011 Jul-Aug <br><p>OBJECTIVE: To examine selected social determinants of a home smoking policy among US households with children and whether these associations vary by the presence of a smoker and children's ages. METHODS: In the 2006/2007 US Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey there were 30,874 parents with 0-17-year-olds. RESULTS: 83.9% of parents reported that no one was allowed to smoke inside the home. However, a no smoking policy varied by the presence of a smoker (93.6% of non-smoking households; 55.8% of smoking households) and children's ages (87.1% of parents with any 0-5-year-olds; 82.1% with 6-17-year-olds only; 79.2% with 14-17-year-olds only). In smoking and non-smoking households, parents of 6-17-year-olds were 25%-46% less likely to have a no smoking policy than parents of younger children. Among smoking households, Hispanic and Asian parents were over twice as likely to not allow smoking inside the home as white parents, while Black parents were half as likely. Parents from more disadvantaged circumstances were less likely to have a no smoking policy.

Many surveys of quit attempts require that the attempt last ≥24 hr, presumably to provide a more objective definition and to eliminate less serious attempts; however, this criterion may bias outcomes by excluding the more dependent quitters who cannot stop for 1 day despite a serious quit attempt. METHODS: We examined the 2003 and the 2006-2007 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey to determine the prevalence of quit attempts that did and did not last 24 hr, both in the last 12 months and in one's lifetime among current daily smokers. We also tested the hypothesis that those unable to quit for 24 hr were the more dependent smokers. RESULTS: Requiring quit attempts to last 24 hr excluded 6%-17% of smokers who stated they made a quit attempt. Whether smokers who could not quit for more than 24 hr were more dependent varied across survey, recall duration, and measure. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude restricting quit attempts to those who have quit for 24 hr underestimates the prevalence of attempts. Whether those unable to quit for 24 hr are the more dependent smokers is unclear. Empirical tests of whether the addition of a 24-hr criterion increases reliability or validity are needed.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20924041?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964925">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Attitude to Health, epidemiology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Motivation, Prevalence, psychology, Reproducibility of Results, Risk Reduction Behavior, Self Efficacy, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Jarvis MJ, Cohen JE, Delnevo CD, Giovino GA, </td><td> <strong>Dispelling myths about gender differences in smoking cessation: population data from the USA, Canada and Britain.</strong> <br> Jarvis MJ, Cohen JE, Delnevo CD, Giovino GA, <br> Journal Article <br> 2013 Sep <br> Tobacco control 22 (5) :356-60 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal84">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal84" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Dispelling myths about gender differences in smoking cessation: population data from the USA, Canada and Britain.</strong> <br> Jarvis MJ, Cohen JE, Delnevo CD, Giovino GA, <br> Journal Article <br> 2013 Sep <br><p>OBJECTIVES: Based mainly on findings from clinical settings, it has been claimed that women are less likely than men to quit smoking successfully. If true, this would have important implications for tobacco control interventions. The authors aimed to test this possibility using data from general population surveys. METHODS: The authors used data from major national surveys conducted in 2006-2007 in the USA (Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey), Canada (Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey) and the UK (General Household Survey) to estimate rates of smoking cessation by age in men and women. RESULTS: The authors found a pattern of gender differences in smoking cessation which was consistent across countries. Below age 50, women were more likely to have given up smoking completely than men, while among older age groups, men were more likely to have quit than women. Across all age groups, there was relatively little difference in cessation between the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions about gender differences in smoking cessation should be based on evidence from the general population rather than from atypical clinical samples. This study has found convincing evidence that men in general are not more likely to quit smoking successfully than women.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22649182?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Canada, Epidemiologic Research Design, epidemiology, Female, Great Britain, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Sex Factors, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Jemal A, Cokkinides VE, Shafey O, Thun MJ, </td><td> <strong>Lung cancer trends in young adults: an early indicator of progress in tobacco control (United States).</strong> <br> Jemal A, Cokkinides VE, Shafey O, Thun MJ, <br> Journal Article <br> 2003 Aug <br> Cancer causes & control : CCC 14 (6) :579-85 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal85">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal85" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Lung cancer trends in young adults: an early indicator of progress in tobacco control (United States).</strong> <br> Jemal A, Cokkinides VE, Shafey O, Thun MJ, <br> Journal Article <br> 2003 Aug <br><p>OBJECTIVE: Tobacco smoking is known to increase lung cancer occurrence beginning in young adulthood, although age-specific rates have not been used to monitor the early consequences of tobacco control efforts in the United States. We evaluated state trends in lung cancer death rates among young adults in relation to an index of state tobacco control activities and conventional indices of current smoking and cessation. METHODS: We calculated lung cancer death rates in young adults (age 30-39 years) over two time intervals from 1990-1994 through 1995-1999 in states with at least 25 deaths per interval. We measured the correlation of an index of state tobacco control in 1992-1993 with absolute rates and with total percent change during the two time intervals. RESULTS: Both lung cancer death rates during the recent time interval (1995-1999) and the change in these rates from 1990-1994 correlated strongly and inversely with the index of state tobacco control efforts measured in 1992-1993. Lung cancer death rates decreased in states with high tobacco control efforts, but increased in states with low tobacco control efforts. Tobacco control indices were strongly and positively correlated with cessation of smoking by age 30-39 years. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer death rates among young adults are strongly and inversely correlated with recent indices of tobacco control. Future monitoring of the effectiveness of statewide comprehensive tobacco control programs should assess trends in lung cancer rates in young adults as well as youth and adult smoking prevalence.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12948289?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Cancer Risk Assessment & Prediction, Tobacco, </td><td> Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, adverse effects, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, epidemiology, Female, Health Services Needs and Demand, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Male, prevention & control, Risk Assessment, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, trends, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Jemal A, Thun M, Yu XQ, Hartman AM, Cokkinides V, Center MM, Ross H, Ward EM, </td><td> <strong>Changes in smoking prevalence among U.S. adults by state and region: Estimates from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, 1992-2007.</strong> <br> Jemal A, Thun M, Yu XQ, Hartman AM, Cokkinides V, Center MM, Ross H, Ward EM, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 <br> BMC public health 11 :512 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal86">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal86" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Changes in smoking prevalence among U.S. adults by state and region: Estimates from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, 1992-2007.</strong> <br> Jemal A, Thun M, Yu XQ, Hartman AM, Cokkinides V, Center MM, Ross H, Ward EM, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 <br><p>BACKGROUND: Tobacco control policies at the state level have been a critical impetus for reduction in smoking prevalence. We examine the association between recent changes in smoking prevalence and state-specific tobacco control policies and activities in the entire U.S. METHODS: We analyzed the 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2006-07 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) by state and two indices of state tobacco control policies or activities [initial outcome index (IOI) and the strength of tobacco control (SOTC) index] measured in 1998-1999. The IOI reflects cigarette excise taxes and indoor air legislation, whereas the SOTC reflects tobacco control program resources and capacity. Pearson Correlation coefficient between the proportionate change in smoking prevalence from 1992-93 to 2006-07 and indices of tobacco control activities or programs was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Smoking prevalence decreased from 1992-93 to 2006-07 in both men and women in all states except Wyoming, where no reduction was observed among men, and only a 6.9% relative reduction among women. The percentage reductions in smoking in men and women respectively were the largest in the West (average decrease of 28.5% and 33.3%) and the smallest in the Midwest (18.6% and 20.3%), although there were notable exceptions to this pattern. The decline in smoking prevalence by state was correlated with the state's IOI in both women and men (r=-0.49, p &lt; 0.001; r=-0.31, p=0.03; respectively) and with state's SOTC index in women(r=-0.30, p=0.03 0), but not men (r=-0.21, p=0.14). CONCLUSION: State level policies on cigarette excise taxes and indoor air legislation correlate strongly with reductions in smoking prevalence since 1992. Strengthening and systematically implementing these policies could greatly accelerate further reductions in smoking.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21714876?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150264">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adult, epidemiology, Female, Health Policy, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Smoking, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Jun HJ, Acevedo-Garcia D, </td><td> <strong>The effect of single motherhood on smoking by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity.</strong> <br> Jun HJ, Acevedo-Garcia D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2007 Aug <br> Social science & medicine (1982) 65 (4) :653-66 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal87">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal87" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The effect of single motherhood on smoking by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity.</strong> <br> Jun HJ, Acevedo-Garcia D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2007 Aug <br><p>We examined the association between parenting young children and smoking among US single women compared with married women, and whether this effect is moderated by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity. Our main finding is that having children reduces smoking except among single white women, and women with low income. We used the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey, a nationally representative dataset (1995-96, n=70,019). Log-binomial regression analysis was used to estimate the association between parenting responsibility (i.e., presence of children aged 0-4 and 5-17) and daily smoking status, after taking into consideration marital status, income, and race/ethnicity. Single women faced a higher risk of smoking than married women. Parenting was protective against smoking among married women but not among single women. Additionally, among single women, the associations between parenting and smoking varied by income and race/ethnicity. Parenting increased the risk of smoking among single women in the lowest income quartile. Single black and Hispanic women with children had a risk of smoking similar to that of their childless counterparts. However, single white women with children were more likely to smoke than their childless counterparts. Smoking cessation interventions and programs to reduce environmental tobacco smoke should recognize that the co-occurrence of single motherhood, parenting responsibility and low-income may increase the risk of smoking. This is particularly significant given the rapid growth of the single women population, and their concentration in poverty in the USA. The finding that parenting is protective against smoking among single minority women, who presumably experience significant stressors, calls for a more thorough investigation of smoking behavior among minority women, and suggests the importance of stress buffers such as social support.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17493724?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, African Americans, Censuses, economics, ethnology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Middle Aged, Mothers, Parent-Child Relations, Parenting, Single-Parent Family, Smoking, Social Class, Social Support, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Kerner JF, Breen N, Tefft MC, Silsby J, </td><td> <strong>Tobacco use among multi-ethnic Latino populations.</strong> <br> Kerner JF, Breen N, Tefft MC, Silsby J, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1998 <br> Ethnicity & disease 8 (2) :167-83 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal88">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal88" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Tobacco use among multi-ethnic Latino populations.</strong> <br> Kerner JF, Breen N, Tefft MC, Silsby J, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1998 <br><p>OBJECTIVES: To examine tobacco use among New York City resident Latin Americans from different countries of origin and with different levels of acculturation reflected by language use. DESIGN: Effective health promotion programs, particularly those aimed at smoking cessation and prevention, require careful investigation into possible cultural and societal factors influencing predictors and barriers to preventive health behavior. National data characterizing cigarette smoking behavior among broadly defined racial/ethnic groups (e.g., black, Hispanic) have rarely examined the extent or importance of cultural variation and acculturation within and among ethnic groups. This report addresses these issues. METHODS: In this study, we examine self-reported cigarette smoking behavior from a 1992 telephone survey of a quota sample of Puerto Rican, Dominican, Colombian, and Ecuadorian Hispanics living in New York City. We compare results from these data with results from a random sample of New York City Hispanics from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the 1992-93 Current Population Survey. RESULTS: Both data sets demonstrated that Puerto Ricans were significantly more likely to be current smokers and ever smokers than the other three Latino groups. Among Hispanic women in the quota sample, those who chose to complete the interview in English were much more likely to report ever smoking than those women who chose to complete the interview in Spanish. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between smoking behavior and acculturation (as measured by language usage) appears to be complex and sensitive to methodological issues of sampling and interview language.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9681283?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Colombia, Cultural Diversity, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, epidemiology, ethnology, Female, Health Surveys, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Language, Male, Middle Aged, New York City, Puerto Rico, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Telephone, </td></tr><tr><td> King BA, Babb SD, Tynan MA, Gerzoff RB, </td><td> <strong>National and state estimates of secondhand smoke infiltration among U.S. multiunit housing residents.</strong> <br> King BA, Babb SD, Tynan MA, Gerzoff RB, <br> Journal Article <br> 2013 Jul <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 15 (7) :1316-21 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal89">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal89" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>National and state estimates of secondhand smoke infiltration among U.S. multiunit housing residents.</strong> <br> King BA, Babb SD, Tynan MA, Gerzoff RB, <br> Journal Article <br> 2013 Jul <br><p>INTRODUCTION: Multiunit housing (MUH) residents are susceptible to secondhand smoke (SHS), which can infiltrate smoke-free living units from nearby units and shared areas where smoking is permitted. This study assessed the prevalence and characteristics of MUH residency in the United States, and the extent of SHS infiltration in this environment at both the national and state levels. METHODS: National and state estimates of MUH residency were obtained from the 2009 American Community Survey. Assessed MUH residency characteristics included sex, age, race/ethnicity, and poverty status. Estimates of smoke-free home rule prevalence were obtained from the 2006-2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The number of MUH residents who have experienced SHS infiltration was determined by multiplying the estimated number of MUH residents with smoke-free homes by the range of self-reported SHS infiltration (44%-46.2%) from peer-reviewed studies of MUH residents. RESULTS: One-quarter of U.S. residents (25.8%, 79.2 million) live in MUH (state range: 10.1% in West Virginia to 51.7% in New York). Nationally, 47.6% of MUH residents are male, 53.3% are aged 25-64 years, 48.0% are non-Hispanic White, and 24.4% live below the poverty level. Among MUH residents with smoke-free home rules (62.7 million), an estimated 27.6-28.9 million have experienced SHS infiltration (state range: 26,000-27,000 in Wyoming to 4.6-4.9 million in California). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of Americans reside in MUH and many of these individuals experience SHS infiltration in their homes. Prohibiting smoking in MUH would help protect MUH residents from involuntary SHS exposure.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23248030?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, California, epidemiology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Hispanic Americans, Housing, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, New York, Self Report, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, West Virginia, Wyoming, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Lawrence D, Fagan P, Backinger CL, Gibson JT, Hartman A, </td><td> <strong>Cigarette smoking patterns among young adults aged 18-24 years in the United States.</strong> <br> Lawrence D, Fagan P, Backinger CL, Gibson JT, Hartman A, <br> Journal Article <br> 2007 Jun <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 9 (6) :687-97 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal90">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal90" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Cigarette smoking patterns among young adults aged 18-24 years in the United States.</strong> <br> Lawrence D, Fagan P, Backinger CL, Gibson JT, Hartman A, <br> Journal Article <br> 2007 Jun <br><p>Most tobacco control programs focus on prevention for children or cessation for adults. Little is known about cigarette smoking among young adults. This study examined sociodemographic variables associated with current, daily, heavy, and light smoking among young adults in the United States. Data from the 1998-1999 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) were used to examine cigarette smoking patterns and correlates of smoking among 15,371 young adults aged 18-24 years. We found that 26% of young adults were current smokers, 20% were daily smokers, and 8% were former smokers. Current smoking rates were higher among American Indians/Alaska Natives (33%) and Whites (31%) than among other racial/ethnic groups. Compared with white-collar workers, blue-collar and service workers were more likely to report current and daily smoking. Blue-collar workers also were more likely to report heavy smoking (OR=1.97). The unemployed (those in the labor force but not currently working) and those reporting an annual household income of less than US$20,000 were more likely to report current, daily, and heavy smoking, compared with those not in the labor force and those reporting an annual household income of $20,000 or more, respectively. Young adults not currently enrolled in school were more than twice as likely to report current (OR=2.36) and daily (OR=2.90) smoking, compared with those currently enrolled in school. Differential cigarette smoking patterns by race/ethnicity, occupation, employment status, household income, and school enrollment status should be considered when developing interventions to reduce smoking among young adults.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17558826?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Confidence Intervals, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, Female, Health Behavior, Health Status, Humans, Male, Multivariate Analysis, Odds Ratio, Population Surveillance, Prevalence, psychology, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Lawrence D, Rose A, Fagan P, Moolchan ET, Gibson JT, Backinger CL, </td><td> <strong>National patterns and correlates of mentholated cigarette use in the United States.</strong> <br> Lawrence D, Rose A, Fagan P, Moolchan ET, Gibson JT, Backinger CL, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2010 Dec <br> Addiction (Abingdon, England) 105 Suppl 1 :13-31 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal91">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal91" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>National patterns and correlates of mentholated cigarette use in the United States.</strong> <br> Lawrence D, Rose A, Fagan P, Moolchan ET, Gibson JT, Backinger CL, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2010 Dec <br><p>AIM: To examine the patterns and correlates of mentholated cigarette smoking among adult smokers in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data on adult current smokers (n=63,193) were pooled from the 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. MEASUREMENTS: The associations between socio-demographic and smoking variables were examined with gender- and race/ethnicity-stratified multivariate logistic regression models predicting current use of mentholated cigarettes. FINDINGS: Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that black smokers were 10-11 times more likely to smoke mentholated cigarettes than white smokers men: odds ratio (OR): 11.59, 99% confidence interval (CI): 9.79-13.72; women: OR: 10.12, 99% CI: 8.45-12.11). With the exception of American Indian/Aleut/Eskimo smokers, non-white smokers were significantly more likely to smoke mentholated cigarettes than were white smokers. Additional significant factors associated with mentholated cigarette smoking included being unmarried (never married: OR: 1.21, 99% CI: 1.09-1.34; divorced/separated: OR: 1.13, 99% CI: 1.03-1.23), being born in a US territory (OR: 2.01, 99% CI: 1.35-3.01), living in a non-metropolitan area (OR: 0.87, 99% CI: 0.80-0.96), being unemployed (OR: 1.24, 99% CI: 1.06-1.44) and lower levels of education. Race/ethnicity-stratified analyses showed that women were more likely than men to smoke mentholated cigarettes. Among black smokers, young adults (aged 18-24 years) were four times more likely to smoke mentholated cigarettes compared with individuals aged 65+. CONCLUSIONS: Race/ethnicity, gender and age are significant correlates of mentholated cigarette smoking among current smokers. Given the importance of menthol in the cigarette market and the potential untoward health effects of this additive, continued surveillance of the prevalence and correlates of mentholated cigarette use among diverse socio-demographic groups is warranted to inform appropriate interventions.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059133?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, African Continental Ancestry Group, Age Factors, Aged, Epidemiologic Methods, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, Female, Humans, Male, Menthol, Middle Aged, Sex Distribution, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Levy DT, Blackman K, Tauras J, Chaloupka FJ, Villanti AC, Niaura RS, Vallone DM, Abrams DB, </td><td> <strong>Quit attempts and quit rates among menthol and nonmenthol smokers in the United States.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Blackman K, Tauras J, Chaloupka FJ, Villanti AC, Niaura RS, Vallone DM, Abrams DB, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 Jul <br> American journal of public health 101 (7) :1241-7 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal92">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal92" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Quit attempts and quit rates among menthol and nonmenthol smokers in the United States.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Blackman K, Tauras J, Chaloupka FJ, Villanti AC, Niaura RS, Vallone DM, Abrams DB, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 Jul <br><p>OBJECTIVES: We compared quit attempts and quit rates among menthol and nonmenthol cigarette smokers in the United States. METHODS: We used data from the 2003 and 2006-2007 waves of the large, nationally representative Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey with control for state-level tobacco control spending, prices, and smoke-free air laws. We estimated mean prevalence, quit rates, and multivariate logistic regression equations by using self-respondent weights for menthol and nonmenthol smokers. RESULTS: In 2003 and 2007, 70% of smokers smoked nonmenthol cigarettes, 26% smoked menthol cigarettes, and 4% had no preference. Quit attempts were 4.3% higher in 2003 and 8.8% higher in 2007 among menthol than nonmenthol smokers. The likelihood of quitting was 3.5% lower for quitting in the past year and 6% lower for quitting in the past 5 years in menthol compared with nonmenthol smokers. Quit success in the past 5 years was further eroded among menthol-smoking Blacks and young adults.

METHODS: The model projects the number of smokers and smoking-related deaths from a baseline year forward. The effects of taxes of different sizes, indexed and unindexed, and temporary vs sustained are modeled. RESULTS: The model predicts that sustained tax increases have the potential to substantially reduce the number of smokers and the number of premature deaths, with the effects growing over time.

METHODS: We first develop a decision theoretic model of quitting behaviour, which incorporates the decision to quit and the choice of treatment. A model of policies to cover the costs of different combinations of treatments and to require health care provider intervention is then incorporated into the quit model. The policy model allows for the smoker to substitute between treatments and for policies to reduce treatment effectiveness. The SimSmoke computer simulation model is then used to examine policy effects on smoking rates and smoking attributable deaths. RESULTS: The model of quit behaviour predicts a population quit rate of 4.3% in 1993, which subsequently falls and then increases in recent years to 4.5%. The policy model suggests a 25% increase in quit rates from a policy that mandates brief interventions and the coverage of all proven treatments. Smaller effects are predicted from policies that mandate more restricted coverage of treatments, especially those limited to behavioural treatment. These policies translate into small reductions in the smoking rate at first, but increase to as much as a 5% reduction in smoking rates. They also lead to substantial savings in lives. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco treatment policies, especially those with broad and flexible coverage, have the potential to increase smoking cessation substantially and decrease smoking rates in the short term, with fairly immediate reductions in deaths.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11891368?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1747666">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Modeling, </td><td></td><td> Computer Simulation, Decision Making, epidemiology, Forecasting, Health Behavior, Humans, methods, psychology, Smoking, Social Control Policies, statistics & numerical data, therapy, Tobacco Use Cessation, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Levy DT, Friend K, </td><td> <strong>A computer simulation model of mass media interventions directed at tobacco use.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Friend K, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2001 Mar <br> Preventive medicine 32 (3) :284-94 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal96">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal96" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>A computer simulation model of mass media interventions directed at tobacco use.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Friend K, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2001 Mar <br><p>OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to develop a simulation model to examine the effects of tobacco control mass media interventions on smoking rates and smoking-attributable deaths.

METHODS: A decision theoretic model of quit behavior is first developed that incorporates the decision to quit and the choice of treatment. A policy model then examines the effect on quit attempts and quit rates of policies to cover the costs of different combinations of treatments and to require health care providers to conduct brief interventions. The model incorporates substitution between treatments and effects of policies on treatment effectiveness. The cost per quit is also calculated for each policy. RESULTS: The model of quit behavior predicts a 1-year quit rate of 4.5% for the population of smokers. The policy model predicts a 37% increase in quit rates from a policy that combines mandated brief interventions with coverage of all proven tobacco treatments. Smaller effects are predicted from policies that provide more restricted coverage of treatments, especially those limited to behavioral treatment. Payments for brief interventions alone increase quit rates by about 7%. Brief intervention and behavioral therapy policies had lower costs per quit but yield substantially fewer additional quits than policies that cover pharmacotherapy. There is, however, considerable variation around these estimates depending on assumptions about the effects of policy on treatment use, substitution between treatments, and treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Tobacco treatment policies, especially those with broad and flexible coverage, have the potential to substantially increase smoking quit rates.

METHODS: We expanded on previous versions of the tobacco control simulation model SimSmoke to assess the effects of an increase in quit attempts, treatment use, and treatment effectiveness to reduce smoking prevalence. In the model, we considered increases in each of these parameters individually and in combination. RESULTS: Individually, 100% increases in quit attempts, treatment use, and treatment effectiveness reduced the projected 2020 prevalence to 13.9%, 16.7%, and 15.9%, respectively. With a combined 100% increase in all components, the goal of a 12% adult smoking prevalence could be reached by 2012. CONCLUSIONS: If we are to come close to reaching Healthy People 2010 goals in the foreseeable future, we must not only induce quit attempts but also increase treatment use and effectiveness.

DESIGN: Using four waves of the nationally representative tobacco use supplement to the current population survey (TUS-CPS)--(1992-2002), the study examined trends and used multivariate logistic models of smoking prevalence among low education women to examine the role of cigarette prices, clean air regulations, and tobacco control media campaigns, while controlling for other personal characteristics. SETTING: USA. PARTICIPANTS: Women ages 18 and older who report not having completed high school, compared with other women with greater educational attainment and men ages 18 and older with less than a high school degree. MAIN RESULTS: Smoking among low education women declined at a greater rate over the study period than among more highly educated women, in contrast with trends of earlier periods. Low education women were found to be particularly responsive to media messages as well as price, especially in comparison with high education women. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between health and socioeconomic status is not immutable; selected tobacco control policies, such as tax increases and media campaigns targeting low education women, may make inroads in reducing the smoking prevalence of this population.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17708007?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2491886">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Costs and Cost Analysis, economics, Educational Status, epidemiology, Female, Humans, Logistic Models, Prevalence, prevention & control, Public Policy, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, United States, Women, </td></tr><tr><td> Levy DT, Nikolayev L, Mumford E, </td><td> <strong>Recent trends in smoking and the role of public policies: results from the SimSmoke tobacco control policy simulation model.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Nikolayev L, Mumford E, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2005 Oct <br> Addiction (Abingdon, England) 100 (10) :1526-36 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal101">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal101" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Recent trends in smoking and the role of public policies: results from the SimSmoke tobacco control policy simulation model.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Nikolayev L, Mumford E, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2005 Oct <br><p>AIMS: After a period of steady decline in smoking prevalence, smoking rates leveled off in the United States between 1990 and 1997, but began falling between 1997 and 2003. Trends in smoking prevalence, and the role of tobacco control policies in affecting those rates, are examined. DESIGN: A computer simulation model is used in which smoking prevalence evolves through initiation and cessation, which are in turn influenced by tobacco control policies. METHODS: The results of the model are compared to smoking prevalence measures from the US National Health Interview Survey between 1993 and 2003. We also consider the role of tax/price, clean air laws, media campaigns and youth access policies in influencing these rates. FINDINGS: Both the SimSmoke model and data for recent years indicate that adult smoking prevalence changed little between 1993 and 1997, and even increased among youth. Between 1997 and 2003, smoking prevalence has been declining. Most age, gender and racial-ethnic groups show patterns similar to that of the entire population, with differences for those aged 18-24 years. The predominant trends were explained mainly by changes in price, with some residual effect of clean air laws, media campaigns and youth access laws. CONCLUSIONS: Among public tobacco control policies, price had the dominant effect on smoking prevalence between 1993 and 2003, because few states implemented other policies to the degree necessary to affect much change. Through continued tax increases, stronger clean air laws, extensive media campaigns and broader cessation treatment programs, there is the potential to have much larger reductions in smoking prevalence.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16185214?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Care Systems, Methods for Assessing Risk Factors, Monitoring Risk Factors, Policy, Preventive & Screening Services, Prevention, Research Methodology, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Modeling, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Health Professional Advice, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Computer Simulation, epidemiology, Female, Forecasting, Health Behavior, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, Prevalence, Public Policy, Smoking, Social Control Policies, Tobacco Industry, trends, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Levy DT, Nikolayev L, Mumford E, Compton C, </td><td> <strong>The Healthy People 2010 smoking prevalence and tobacco control objectives: results from the SimSmoke tobacco control policy simulation model (United States).</strong> <br> Levy DT, Nikolayev L, Mumford E, Compton C, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2005 May <br> Cancer causes & control : CCC 16 (4) :359-71 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal102">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal102" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The Healthy People 2010 smoking prevalence and tobacco control objectives: results from the SimSmoke tobacco control policy simulation model (United States).</strong> <br> Levy DT, Nikolayev L, Mumford E, Compton C, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2005 May <br><p>OBJECTIVES: Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) set a goal of reducing the adult smoking prevalence to 12% by 2010. Smoking prevalence rates do not appear to be declining at or near the rate targeted in the HP2010 goals. The purpose of this paper is to examine the attainability of HP2010 smoking prevalence objectives through the stricter tobacco control policies suggested in HP2010. METHODS: A tested dynamic simulation model of smoking trends, known as SimSmoke, is applied. Smoking prevalence evolves over time through initiation and cessation, behaviors which are in turned influenced by tobacco control policies. We consider the effect of changes in taxes/prices, clean air laws, media campaigns, cessation programs and youth access policies on projected smoking prevalence over the period 2003-2020, focusing on the levels in 2010. RESULTS: The SimSmoke model projects that the aging of older cohorts and the impact of policies in years prior to 2004 will yield a reduction in smoking rates to 18.4% by 2010, which is substantially above the 2010 target of 12%. When policies similar to the HP2010 tobacco control policy objectives are implemented, SimSmoke projects that smoking rates could be reduced to 16.1%. Further reductions might be realized by increasing the tax rate by $1.00. CONCLUSIONS: The SimSmoke model suggests that the HP2010 smoking prevalence objective is unlikely to be attained. Although we are unlikely to reach the goals by meeting the HP2010 policy objectives, they could get us much closer to the goal. Emphasis should be placed on meeting the tax, clean air, media/comprehensive campaigns, and cessation treatment objectives.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15953978?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Cancer Risk Assessment & Prediction, Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, </td><td></td><td> Computer Simulation, epidemiology, Female, Forecasting, Health Behavior, Healthy People Programs, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, methods, Policy Making, Prevalence, prevention & control, psychology, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Smoking, Social Control Policies, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Use Cessation, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Levy DT, Pearson JL, Villanti AC, Blackman K, Vallone DM, Niaura RS, Abrams DB, </td><td> <strong>Modeling the future effects of a menthol ban on smoking prevalence and smoking-attributable deaths in the United States.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Pearson JL, Villanti AC, Blackman K, Vallone DM, Niaura RS, Abrams DB, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 Jul <br> American journal of public health 101 (7) :1236-40 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal103">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal103" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Modeling the future effects of a menthol ban on smoking prevalence and smoking-attributable deaths in the United States.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Pearson JL, Villanti AC, Blackman K, Vallone DM, Niaura RS, Abrams DB, <br> Journal Article <br> 2011 Jul <br><p>We used a validated smoking simulation model and data from the 2003 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey to project the impact that a US menthol ban would have on smoking prevalence and smoking-attributable deaths.

The study used the U.S. Current Population Survey 1998-1999 Tobacco Use Supplement, supplemented with information on state-level tobacco control policies. The sample was limited to individuals aged 25 years or older who were smoking daily 1 year ago. We estimated frequencies and multivariate logistic equations for making a quit attempt and remaining abstinent at least 3 months. These measures were related to demographic characteristics, smoking intensity, and tobacco control policies. Younger, higher socioeconomic status (SES), and less intense (fewer cigarettes per day) daily smokers were more likely to make quit attempts, but the likelihood of remaining abstinent for those making a quit attempt was greater for older, higher SES, and heavy daily smokers. We found evidence that cessation behaviors were related to higher cigarette prices and the presence of state-level media/comprehensive campaigns, but less clear evidence exists for an association with bans restricting workplace smoking. The results indicate that certain types of smokers are more likely to attempt to quit and to have success and that the characteristics of these smokers differ. Price policies can have an important role in helping daily smokers to quit. Further research is needed regarding the role of quantity smoked.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16085506?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Aged, Demography, Female, Health Policy, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Likelihood Functions, Male, Middle Aged, Smoking Cessation, Social Class, Tobacco Industry, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Levy DT, Romano E, Mumford EA, </td><td> <strong>Recent trends in home and work smoking bans.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Romano E, Mumford EA, <br> Journal Article <br> 2004 Sep <br> Tobacco control 13 (3) :258-63 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal105">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal105" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Recent trends in home and work smoking bans.</strong> <br> Levy DT, Romano E, Mumford EA, <br> Journal Article <br> 2004 Sep <br><p>OBJECTIVES: Home and work smoking bans at the national and state level in the USA, and their relation to smoking prevalence and to tobacco control policies, are examined. DATA: The Current Population Survey's 1992/93 and 1998/99 tobacco use supplement surveys are the primary data source, supplemented with information on state level tobacco control policies. METHODS: The national and state rate of bans are estimated, and changes over the course of the 1990s and their relation to smoking rates and tobacco control policies are examined. RESULTS: The prevalence of work and home bans has increased considerably between 1992/93 and 1998/99. By 1999, over 65% of the population age 15 and above work in places with smoking bans, and over 60% live in homes with bans. We found that states with lower than average ban rates in 1993 tended to have had larger increases in ban rates between 1993 and 1999. We also found that home and work bans became more prevalent in states with initially low smoking rates, and that the growth in home bans coincided with a declining prevalence of smoking. States with higher levels of bans by 1999 also tended to have higher cigarette taxes, stricter clean air laws, and media/comprehensive campaigns in place. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that lower smoking rates are associated with higher rates of work and home bans, although substantial progress has also been made by those states with initially low rates of bans. While further work is needed to establish the direction of causality, it would appear that reductions in smoking rates, either through stronger tobacco control policies or otherwise, may reduce exposure to tobacco smoke not only by reducing the number of smokers, but also through increasing the number of firms and homes with smoking restrictions.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15333881?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1747888">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Family Health, Health Policy, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Occupational Exposure, Occupational Health, prevention & control, Smoking, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Lewis DR, Clegg LX, Johnson NJ, </td><td> <strong>Lung disease mortality in the United States: the National Longitudinal Mortality Study.</strong> <br> Lewis DR, Clegg LX, Johnson NJ, <br> Journal Article <br> 2009 Aug <br> The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease 13 (8) :1008-14 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal106">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal106" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Lung disease mortality in the United States: the National Longitudinal Mortality Study.</strong> <br> Lewis DR, Clegg LX, Johnson NJ, <br> Journal Article <br> 2009 Aug <br><p>SETTING: The National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) offers the advantage of assessing mortality in a representative population of the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate health disparities associated with lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality in the United States and whether these associations are similar between these outcomes. DESIGN: The NLMS is a prospective study. Data from NLMS cohort years 1985, 1992, 1993, 1995 and 1996 were included, representing nearly 1.5 million person-years. Lung cancer and COPD mortality relative risks (RRs) from Cox regression analysis, including residential characteristics, marital status, education, health insurance and family income, were evaluated. RESULTS: By 1998, 1273 lung cancer deaths and 772 COPD deaths occurred. Lung cancer mortality rates were approximately two times higher than COPD mortality rates among race and ethnic groups. Cox regression analysis revealed that low education (RR=1.77, significant, P=0.01) and low family income (RR=1.50, significant, P=0.01) are associated with lung cancer and COPD mortality, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex and smoking status.

A standard econometric approach is to estimate the relationship between cigarette prices and smoking participation at a point in time. I extend this approach to model past-year decisions to start, resume or quit smoking. Considering reverse causality, I apply an instrumental variable (excise taxes) for cigarette prices. I include an index of state-level anti-smoking sentiment to control for omitted variable bias. After estimating separate models for smoking initiation, relapse and cessation and for different age groups, I find no evidence that increasing taxes on cigarettes can prevent the onset of youth smoking. Neither does it effectively induce young smokers to quit. However, cigarette prices do play an important role to prevent relapse and encourage quitting at older ages.</p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036840801964880" target="_blank">Visit this publication's Web page</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Modeling, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Liu F, </td><td> <strong>Quit attempts and intention to quit cigarette smoking among Medicaid recipients in the USA.</strong> <br> Liu F, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Oct <br> Public health 124 (10) :553-8 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal109">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal109" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Quit attempts and intention to quit cigarette smoking among Medicaid recipients in the USA.</strong> <br> Liu F, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Oct <br><p>OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of Medicaid coverage of tobacco dependence treatments (TDT) on quitting attempts and intention to quit by Medicaid recipient smokers.

Measures included self-reported quit attempts during the last 12 months, and serious intention to quit in the next 6 months and in the next 30 days. RESULTS: In the baseline model, Medicaid coverage of TDT was associated with attempted quitting [odds ratio (OR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.45], intention to quit in the next 6 months (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.59) and intention to quit in the next 30 days (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.58).

METHODS: Data from both the Current Population Survey's (CPS) Tobacco Use Supplements administered September 1998, January 1999, and May 1999 and from the 2000 Behavioral Risk Factor Survey System (BRFSS) were analyzed and compared. The weighted proportions and 95% confidence intervals of Wisconsin and US smokers who had seen a physician in the past year and reported receiving advice from them to quit smoking were calculated. Proportions were analyzed for the total population as well as for subgroups of gender, age, race, educational level, and income level. RESULTS: CPS data showed that Wisconsin smokers who had seen a physician in the past year were significantly more likely to receive smoking cessation advice from their physician (64%) compared to US smokers (59%). Though not significant, a similar trend was seen in the BRFSS data. There were no consistent significant differences in rates analyzed by gender, age, race, educational level, or income level. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the CPS and BRFSS show that less than two thirds of Wisconsin smokers are receiving smoking cessation advice from their physicians. Increasing physician counseling of patients who smoke continues to be a priority public health goal for decreasing morbidity and mortality from tobacco-related illnesses.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14621930?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Professional Advice, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Aged, Counseling, epidemiology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Office Visits, Physician's Practice Patterns, Population Surveillance, Risk Factors, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Wisconsin, </td></tr><tr><td> McGrady GA, Pederson LL, </td><td> <strong>Do sex and ethnic differences in smoking initiation mask similarities in cessation behavior?</strong> <br> McGrady GA, Pederson LL, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2002 Jun <br> American journal of public health 92 (6) :961-5 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal112">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal112" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Do sex and ethnic differences in smoking initiation mask similarities in cessation behavior?</strong> <br> McGrady GA, Pederson LL, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2002 Jun <br><p>OBJECTIVES: This study compared success in smoking cessation by sex, ethnic status, and birth cohort.

There have been efforts to apply and enforce state laws limiting workplace smoking. There has been little study of the relative effectiveness of state and/or local laws in affecting both rates of workplace ETS exposure and adult smoking rates. This study investigates these hypotheses, as well as the effect of these laws on youth smoking. DESIGN: This is a secondary data analysis using sources including the Current Population Survey (CPS), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), and the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA) between the years of 1996 and 1999. Linear regression models were used to investigate the effect of a state's clean indoor air (CIA) law (using a measure of extensiveness) on the overall amount of people who reported working in a smoke-free environment, youth smoking rates and adult smoking rates. RESULTS: The extensiveness of a state's CIA law was found to be a reliable predictor of the percentage of indoor workers who report a smoke-free work environment and the rates of youth smoking. State CIA laws were not conclusively associated with adult smoking rates. CONCLUSIONS: The extensiveness of a state's CIA law is strongly associated with a higher percentage of indoor workers reporting a smoke-free work environment. This study did not reveal a similar association between local laws and smoke-free work environments. Youth smoking rates, shown to be related to state CIA laws, may be further affected with more stringent CIA policy.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15735299?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1747974">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Air Pollution, Indoor, economics, epidemiology, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, methods, Occupational Exposure, Politics, Population Surveillance, Poverty, prevention & control, Smoking, Taxes, Tobacco, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Messer K, Mills AL, White MM, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>The effect of smoke-free homes on smoking behavior in the U.S.</strong> <br> Messer K, Mills AL, White MM, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Sep <br> American journal of preventive medicine 35 (3) :210-6 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal114">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal114" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The effect of smoke-free homes on smoking behavior in the U.S.</strong> <br> Messer K, Mills AL, White MM, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Sep <br><p>BACKGROUND: Evidence from longitudinal population surveys is needed to establish whether smoke-free homes might influence smoking behavior. METHODS: The Tobacco Use Supplement of the nationally representative U.S. Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) interviewed 3292 adult recent smokers in 2002 and again 12 months later. Both surveys measured smoking status, rules on smoking in the home, and the number of cigarettes smoked per day (cpd). For the main study outcome, an early marker of successful cessation (>or=90 days quit) was used. Analysis was completed in 2008. RESULTS: In the 12 months ending February 2003, the prevalence of smoke-free homes among recent smokers increased from 33% to 39%. A smoke-free home at baseline was associated with >or=90 days cessation at follow-up (10.9% vs 6.2%, AOR=1.44; 95% CI=0.97, 2.21), and those who maintained a smoke-free home were more likely to be >or=90 days quit than those who did not (12.9% vs 5.7%, AOR=1.99; 95% CI=0.93, 4.25). However, adopting a smoke-free home during the year was associated with a nearly fivefold increase in the percentage of >or=90 days quit (AOR=4.81; 95% CI=3.06, 7.59). This increase was seen among all smokers, including moderate-to-heavy smokers (>or=90 days quit: a smoke-free home=13.0% vs no smoke-free home=2.9%, p&lt;0.001). Among continuing smokers with a smoke-free home at baseline, maintenance of te smoke-free home was associated with a decline in consumption (micro=or-2.18; 95 CI=or-1.24; -3.10 cpd). Among continuing smokers with no smoke-free home at baseline, adoption of that status was also associated with a decline in consumption (micro=or-1.72; 95% CI=or-0.58; -2.85 cpd).

SETTING: Retrospective smoking history of a population sample from the US: from CA, with a comprehensive tobacco-control programme since 1989 with the goal of denormalising tobacco use; from New York and New Jersey (NY & NJ), with similar high cigarette prices but no comprehensive programme; and from the tobacco-growing states (TGS), with low cigarette prices, no tobacco-control programme and social norms relatively supportive of tobacco use. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents to the Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplements (1992-2002; n=57 918 non-Hispanic white ever-smokers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of recent ever-smokers attaining long-term abstinence (quit > or=1 year) and the successful-quit ratio (the proportion of all ever-smokers abstinent > or=1 year). RESULTS: Nationally, long-term cessation rates increased by 25% from the 1980s to the 1990s, averaging 3.4% per year in the 1990s. Cessation increased for all age groups, and by > 40% (p&lt;0.001) among smokers aged 20-34 years. For smokers aged &lt; 50 years, higher cigarette prices were associated with higher quitting rates. For smokers aged &lt; 35 years, quitting rates in CA were higher than in either comparison group (p&lt;0.05). Half of the ever-smokers had quit smoking by age 44 years in CA, 47 years in NY & NJ, and by age 54 years in TGS. CONCLUSION: Successful smoking cessation increased by 25% during the 1990s in the US.

Among those who seriously tried to quit, a smoke-free home was associated with quitting for 6 months or longer (odds ratio [OR]=4.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.25, 5.26). Compared with older smokers, young adults were more likely to have smoke-free homes (43% vs 30%, P&lt;.01), were less likely to use pharmaceutical aids (9.8% vs 23.7%, P&lt;.01), and smoked fewer cigarettes per day (13.2% vs 17.4%, P&lt;.01). CONCLUSIONS: Young adults were more likely than were older adults to quit smoking successfully. This could be explained partly by young adults, more widespread interest in quitting, higher prevalence of smoke-free homes, and lower levels of dependence. High cessation rates among young adults may also reflect changing social norms.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18172143?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376894">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Data Collection, epidemiology, Female, Housing, Humans, Male, methods, Middle Aged, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, therapy, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Mills AL, Messer K, Gilpin EA, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>The effect of smoke-free homes on adult smoking behavior: a review.</strong> <br> Mills AL, Messer K, Gilpin EA, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review <br> 2009 Oct <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 11 (10) :1131-41 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal117">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal117" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The effect of smoke-free homes on adult smoking behavior: a review.</strong> <br> Mills AL, Messer K, Gilpin EA, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review <br> 2009 Oct <br><p>INTRODUCTION: Smoke-free homes are known to reduce exposure to harmful secondhand smoke. Recent studies suggest that they may also positively affect smoking behavior among smokers themselves. METHODS: We review the literature on the effect of smoke-free homes on adult smoking behavior. The literature search included database (PubMed) and manual searches of related articles and reference lists for English-language studies published from 1 January 1990 to 16 November 2008. RESULTS: We identified 16 cross-sectional and 7 longitudinal studies of the population-level association of smoke-free homes with adult smoking behavior. Additional studies provided population estimates of trends in and correlates of smoke-free homes. Prevalence of smoke-free homes varies but has been increasing over time in the countries studied and was greater among smokers who were younger, of higher income or educational attainment, smoked fewer cigarettes per day, or lived with a nonsmoking adult or child. Both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies showed that smokers who had or who newly implemented a smoke-free home were significantly more likely to make a quit attempt and to be abstinent, after controlling for confounding factors. In longitudinal studies, those who continued to smoke had a modest, but significant, decrease in cigarette consumption at follow-up. DISCUSSION: There is strong and consistent population-level evidence that a smoke-free home is associated with increased smoking cessation and decreased cigarette consumption in adult smokers. As they not only reduce exposure to secondhand smoke but also increase cessation rates, promotion of smoke-free homes should be a key element in tobacco control programs.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19633273?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Humans, Prevalence, psychology, Residence Characteristics, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, </td></tr><tr><td> Mills AL, White MM, Pierce JP, Messer K, </td><td> <strong>Home smoking bans among U.S. households with children and smokers.

PURPOSE: To examine prevalence of home smoking bans among U.S. households with both children and smokers, over time and by demographic subgroups. METHODS: The Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) is a nationally representative household survey of tobacco use. The 1992/1993 and 2006/2007 TUS-CPS interviewed 22,746 households from a major racial/ethnic group with both children and adult smokers. Predictors of complete home smoking bans among demographic subgroups were identified using multivariate logistic regression. Analyses were conducted in 2010-2011. RESULTS: Complete home smoking bans among U.S. households with children and smokers (smoking families) more than tripled, from 14.1% in 1992/1993 to 50.0% in 2006/2007. However, non-Hispanic white and African-American smoking families lagged behind Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics. In 2006/2007, 67.2% of African-American smoking families allowed smoking in the home, as did 59.2% of smoking families with all children aged ≥14 years. Bans were more likely among more-educated households and in states with lower adult smoking prevalence; however, these differences were attenuated in some racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: As of 2006/2007, only half of U.S. households with both children and smokers had complete home smoking bans. Home bans were less common among smoking families with older children, in African-American households, and in Hispanic or non-Hispanic white households in states with high smoking prevalence. Interventions are needed to promote smoke-free homes among these groups.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099231?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Child, Child, Preschool, epidemiology, Family Characteristics, Health Surveys, Housing, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Logistic Models, prevention & control, Public Health, Public Policy, Smoking, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Mowery PD, Babb S, Hobart R, Tworek C, MacNeil A, </td><td> <strong>The impact of state preemption of local smoking restrictions on public health protections and changes in social norms.</strong> <br> Mowery PD, Babb S, Hobart R, Tworek C, MacNeil A, <br> Journal Article <br> 2012 <br> Journal of environmental and public health 2012 :632629 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal119">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal119" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The impact of state preemption of local smoking restrictions on public health protections and changes in social norms.</strong> <br> Mowery PD, Babb S, Hobart R, Tworek C, MacNeil A, <br> Journal Article <br> 2012 <br><p>INTRODUCTION: Preemption is a legislative or judicial arrangement in which a higher level of government precludes lower levels of government from exercising authority over a topic. In the area of smoke-free policy, preemption typically takes the form of a state law that prevents communities from adopting local smoking restrictions. BACKGROUND: A broad consensus exists among tobacco control practitioners that preemption adversely impacts tobacco control efforts. This paper examines the effect of state provisions preempting local smoking restrictions in enclosed public places and workplaces. METHODS: Multiple data sources were used to assess the impact of state preemptive laws on the proportion of indoor workers covered by smoke-free workplace policies and public support for smoke-free policies. We controlled for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: State preemptive laws were associated with fewer local ordinances restricting smoking, a reduced level of worker protection from secondhand smoke, and reduced support for smoke-free policies among current smokers. DISCUSSION: State preemptive laws have several effects that could impede progress in secondhand smoke protections and broader tobacco control efforts. Conclusion. Practitioners and advocates working on other public health issues should familiarize themselves with the benefits of local policy making and the potential impact of preemption.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22654921?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3359706">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Policy, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Attitude to Health, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Policy Making, Public Health, Smoking, State Government, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Mumford EA, Levy DT, Gitchell JG, Blackman KO, </td><td> <strong>Smokeless tobacco use 1992-2002: trends and measurement in the Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplements.</strong> <br> Mumford EA, Levy DT, Gitchell JG, Blackman KO, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2006 Jun <br> Tobacco control 15 (3) :166-71 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal120">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal120" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Smokeless tobacco use 1992-2002: trends and measurement in the Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplements.</strong> <br> Mumford EA, Levy DT, Gitchell JG, Blackman KO, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2006 Jun <br><p>BACKGROUND: As smoking prevalence declines in the United States, it is important to understand if smokeless tobacco (SLT) use is also changing and if so, among what groups. METHODS: We examine the prevalence of SLT use and smoking, 1992-2002, using the Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplements (CPS-TUS), which used US nationally representative samples based on stratified clusters of households. RESULTS: Consistent with declines in smoking, the prevalence of current SLT use declined over the period 1992-2002 for males and females ages 18 and older. The overall separate declines in SLT use and in smoking are mirrored by a decline in concurrent use of SLT and cigarettes. SLT use is becoming more associated with white males, but use is declining faster among the youngest males. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that relative reductions in smoking prevalence are exceeded by relative reductions in SLT use, with sizeable reductions in concurrent use. These results suggest that the stricter cigarette policies of recent years may not only reduce cigarette use, but also the use of alternative tobacco products. In light of potential policy implications of SLT use as a potential reduced exposure product (PREP), current survey methods require more careful measurement of SLT use in terms of initiation, duration, quantity, and cessation.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16728746?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2564653">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, epidemiology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Prevalence, Sex Factors, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Cessation, Tobacco Use Disorder, Tobacco, Smokeless, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Mumford EA, Levy DT, Gitchell JG, Blackman KO, </td><td> <strong>Tobacco control policies and the concurrent use of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes among men, 1992-2002.</strong> <br> Mumford EA, Levy DT, Gitchell JG, Blackman KO, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2005 Dec <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 7 (6) :891-900 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal121">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal121" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Tobacco control policies and the concurrent use of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes among men, 1992-2002.</strong> <br> Mumford EA, Levy DT, Gitchell JG, Blackman KO, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2005 Dec <br><p>Accelerating the decline in smoking prevalence requires an understanding of changes in the concurrent use of and the substitution between different tobacco products, such as smokeless tobacco (SLT) and cigarettes. SLT could play an important role in reducing the toll of smoking-related illness and premature mortality. Research examining the role of tobacco control policies in explaining concurrent use of SLT and cigarettes has been minimal. Using the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements (CPS-TUS), we examined tobacco control policies in relationship with adult males' SLT use concurrent with smoking over the period 1992-2002. Consistent with the decline in smokeless-only and cigarette-only rates, concurrent use of SLT and cigarettes declined during the period. SLT users, faced with home or workplace smoking bans, are less likely to report smoking. Smokers with a home ban appear more likely to use SLT, but in more recent years, smokers with a workplace ban are less likely to use SLT. Tobacco excise taxes do not signal substitution between cigarettes and SLT products. Understanding current use patterns of the range of tobacco products, including their interaction with available policy levers, is vital in assessing whether changes that might promote substitution of arguably less toxic SLT products for highly toxic cigarettes are likely to lead to net public health gains or losses. Findings of the present study, in concert with other research about transitional probabilities between behavioral states, will inform the design of an effective policy framework that supports the objective of reducing tobacco-related death and disease.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298724?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Smokeless Tobacco, Tobacco - Other Tobacco Products, </td><td></td><td> Adult, epidemiology, Health Policy, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, methods, Middle Aged, prevention & control, Public Health, Risk Factors, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, standards, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Use Disorder, Tobacco, Smokeless, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Mumford EA, Levy DT, Romano EO, </td><td> <strong>Home smoking restrictions.

The purpose of this study was to examine who is affected by strict home smoking bans at the household level. METHODS: Using the 1998/1999 Tobacco Use Supplement to the U.S. Current Population Survey, we examined the characteristics of 43,613 households with two or more adults who responded to the home ban question. Analyses were conducted in 2003-2004. RESULTS: An estimated 12% of sample households provided inconsistent reports about home smoking bans. Multimember households with smokers were substantially less likely to consistently report strict home bans. Discrepancies vary systematically by smoking behavior, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. Children living with smokers are especially at risk of inconsistent adult reports. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses should not rely on individual reports of home bans, especially in households with smokers and children. Policies should be directed toward educating members of households with smokers and children about the importance of household bans.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15261899?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco -

Using data from 52,418 construction workers in the Tobacco Use Supplement to the United States Current Population Survey, we examined the association of labor market shock, cigarette prices, and state antismoking sentiments with smoking status and average number of cigarettes smoked daily. Data analysis included the use of multiple linear and logistic regressions, which employed the sampling and replicate weights to account for sampling design. Unemployed, American-Indian, lower-educated and lower-income workers had higher smoking rates. Labor market shock had a quadratic association, which was non-significant for smoking status and significant for number of cigarettes. The association of cigarette prices with smoking status became non-significant after adjusting for state-level antismoking sentiment. State-level antismoking sentiment had significant quadratic association with smoking status among employed workers and significant quadratic association with number of cigarettes for all smokers. The study highlights how both workplace-based smoking cessation interventions and antismoking sentiments could further contribute to disparities in smoking by employment status.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22795358?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510701">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Attitude to Health, Commerce, Construction Industry, economics, epidemiology, Female, Humans, Linear Models, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, psychology, Smoking, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Products, Unemployment, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Okechukwu CA, Dutra LM, Bacic J, El Ayadi A, Emmons KM, </td><td> <strong>Home matters: work and household predictors of smoking and cessation among blue-collar workers.</strong> <br> Okechukwu CA, Dutra LM, Bacic J, El Ayadi A, Emmons KM, <br> Journal Article <br> 2013 Feb <br> Preventive medicine 56 (2) :130-4 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal134">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal134" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Home matters: work and household predictors of smoking and cessation among blue-collar workers.</strong> <br> Okechukwu CA, Dutra LM, Bacic J, El Ayadi A, Emmons KM, <br> Journal Article <br> 2013 Feb <br><p>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the joint influence of work- and household-related variables on smoking behavior among a population representative sample of blue-collar workers with live-in partners. METHODS: The study used data on 1389 blue-collar workers from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the United States Current Population Survey 2002 to 2003 longitudinal overlap sample. Unadjusted and adjusted logistical regression analyses, which employed sampling and replicate weights to account for sampling design, were run to estimate independent and joint effects of the predictors. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, partner smoking (OR=4.97, 95%CI=3.02-8.18) and complete and partial home smoking policy (OR=0.16, 95%CI=0.09-0.29 and OR=0.39, 95%CI=0.23-0.68, respectively) were significant predictors of smoking status, but worksite smoking policies and presence of a young child under 5 in the household were not (p>0.05). Baseline complete home smoking ban was a significant predictor of subsequent cessation (OR=3.49, 95%CI=1.19-10.23), while partner smoking status, workplace smoking policy, and the presence of a young child in the home did not predict cessation (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Household-related variables were significant predictors of smoking status and cessation among blue-collar workers. Current efforts to decrease smoking in this group, which are mostly focused on work-related risk factors, should consider how to incorporate household risk factors.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23262360?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552033">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adult, Employment, epidemiology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, legislation & jurisprudence, Logistic Models, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Middle Aged, Predictive Value of Tests, psychology, Residence Characteristics, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, United States, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Osypuk TL, Acevedo-Garcia D, </td><td> <strong>Support for smoke-free policies: a nationwide analysis of immigrants, US-born, and other demographic groups, 1995-2002.</strong> <br> Osypuk TL, Acevedo-Garcia D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Jan <br> American journal of public health 100 (1) :171-81 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal135">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal135" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Support for smoke-free policies: a nationwide analysis of immigrants, US-born, and other demographic groups, 1995-2002.</strong> <br> Osypuk TL, Acevedo-Garcia D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Jan <br><p>OBJECTIVES: We examined whether support for tobacco control policies varies by demographic group, including nativity status (i.e., immigrant versus US born). METHODS: We analyzed 1995 to 2002 data from the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement (n=543,951). The outcome was a summary attitudinal measure assessing support of smoking bans in 4 of 6 venues. RESULTS: US-born respondents, smokers, male respondents, Native Americans, Whites, and those who were unmarried, of lower socioeconomic status, and whose workplaces and homes were not smoke free were less likely to support smoking bans. Immigrants exhibited stronger support for banning smoking in every venue, with a generation-specific gradient in which support eroded with increasing assimilation to the United States. Levels of support were more than twice as high among immigrants as among US-born respondents (odds ratio [OR]=2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.08, 2.23). Naturalized citizens displayed higher support than US-born citizens, which may be relevant for mobilization of the electorate. Differences in population composition and contexts (e.g., smoke-free workplaces) only partially accounted for immigrants' stronger level of support.

We explored and mapped the variation in smoking prevalence for racial/ethnic groups by gender and state after adjusting for demographic factors. METHODS: We executed a cross-sectional, weighted, two-level multilevel multiple regression analysis (individuals in states), with current smoking as the outcome, using the 1995-1996 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement, for non-Hispanic (NH) whites, NH blacks, and Hispanics. We also calculated adjusted smoking prevalence, 95% confidence intervals, Spearman correlations, and state residual-based maps to examine state patterns. RESULTS: We found different smoking patterns for each racial group. Black women's smoking rates were markedly lower than the national subgroup rate in six clustered states in the deep South. Smoking rates for whites were higher than the subgroup national rate in several Great Lakes states, Texas, Nevada, and North Carolina. For white women, several rural Midwest states displayed lower-than-expected smoking rates (Idaho, Utah, South Dakota, and Nebraska). We documented positive correlations for smoking prevalence between men and women within each racial group, but not between racial groups, indicating a race-specific pattern of smoking. We found that state tobacco variables (taxation and agriculture) did not account for remaining state smoking variance after inclusion of demographic variables. CONCLUSION: Multilevel modeling may enhance surveillance of tobacco use patterns. Focusing on race-specific state smoking patterns may illuminate why racial/ethnic minority groups exhibit lower smoking prevalence compared to their white counterparts, by examining context of smoking that may be race-specific.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16972510?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564457">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Methods for Assessing Risk Factors, Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, African Continental Ancestry Group, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cross-Sectional Studies, Emigration and Immigration, ethnology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Smoking, statistics & numerical data, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Osypuk TL, Subramanian SV, Kawachi I, Acevedo-Garcia D, </td><td> <strong>Is workplace smoking policy equally prevalent and equally effective among immigrants?</strong> <br> Osypuk TL, Subramanian SV, Kawachi I, Acevedo-Garcia D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2009 Oct <br> Journal of epidemiology and community health 63 (10) :784-91 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal137">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal137" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Is workplace smoking policy equally prevalent and equally effective among immigrants?</strong> <br> Osypuk TL, Subramanian SV, Kawachi I, Acevedo-Garcia D, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2009 Oct <br><p>BACKGROUND: This study examined whether immigrants were less likely to be covered by a smoke-free workplace policy and whether workplace smoking policies garnered comparable associations with smoking for immigrants and for those born in the USA. METHODS: Investigators applied multiple logistic regression to the 2001-2 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement among US indoor workers (n=85,784). The study examined first, whether nativity (immigrants vs US born) was independently associated with smoke-free policy coverage, and second, whether the smoke-free policy association with current smoking was differential by nativity (effect modification). RESULTS: Immigrants were less likely to work in smoke-free workplaces than those born in the USA; however, occupation and industry accounted for these disparities. Employment in a workplace that was not smoke free was associated with higher odds of smoking (vs smoke-free workplaces), both before (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.74 to 1.92) and after (OR 1.36, CI 1.29 to 1.44) covariate adjustment among the US born, but associations were weaker among immigrants (OR 1.39, CI 1.20 to 1.61, unadjusted; OR 1.15 CI 0.97 to 1.35 adjusted). Worker industry partly explained (16% of) the weaker policy-smoking association among immigrants, while other socioeconomic variables reduced the policy-smoking association without explaining the disparity. CONCLUSIONS: The patchwork of US workplace smoking restriction policy at different governmental levels, combined with a voluntary regime among some employers, generates coverage inequalities. Workplace smoke-free policies may be less effective for immigrants, and this is related to differential coverage by such policies due to occupational segregation. Understanding the complex patterns of the social context of smoking is important for understanding how policy interventions might have heterogeneous effects for different demographic groups.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19359272?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843581">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Tobacco, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Emigrants and Immigrants, epidemiology, Female, Health Policy, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Odds Ratio, prevention & control, Smoking, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Pabilonia SW, Song Y, </td><td> <strong>Single mothers' time preference, smoking, and enriching childcare: evidence from time diaries</strong> <br> Pabilonia SW, Song Y, <br><br> <br> Eastern Economic Journal In press. : <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal138">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal138" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Single mothers' time preference, smoking, and enriching childcare: evidence from time diaries</strong> <br> Pabilonia SW, Song Y, <br><br> <br><p>Previous research has shown that time preference affects individuals’ market time allocation and own human capital investments.

Public views on the health effects of tobacco use have changed such that now a majority of individuals believe that smoking and secondhand smoke are harmful. While the public tends to blame the smoker for health problems, there is strong support for restrictions on tobacco advertising, although support is lower in tobacco-producing states. Generally, the public has become more supportive of smoking restrictions in various public domains, although there are important differences across states depending on tobacco production. Evidence suggests that trends in opinion toward tobacco use and anti-smoking legislation have coincided with the decline in smoking prevalence and the increase in anti-smoking policies and public health awareness reports at the federal, state, and local levels.</p><a href="http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/75/3/576.short" target="_blank">Visit this publication's Web page</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Parascandola M, Augustson E, Rose A, </td><td> <strong>Characteristics of current and recent former smokers associated with the use of new potential reduced-exposure tobacco products.</strong> <br> Parascandola M, Augustson E, Rose A, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2009 Dec <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 11 (12) :1431-8 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal140">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal140" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Characteristics of current and recent former smokers associated with the use of new potential reduced-exposure tobacco products.</strong> <br> Parascandola M, Augustson E, Rose A, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2009 Dec <br><p>OBJECTIVES: To identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with having tried a potentialy reduced-exposure tobacco product (PREP) and to compare the smoking and quitting behaviors and attitudes of smokers who have tried a PREP product with non-PREP users. METHODS: Analysis is based on a sample of 43,419 current and recent former smokers from the 2003 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. RESULTS: Overall, PREP use is low (2.5%). Current daily and someday only smokers have higher rates of use (2.9% and 2.4%, respectively) compared with former smokers (1.5%). PREP use is higher in southern states and among younger smokers, non-Hispanic Whites, and those with some college education. Smokers who have tried a PREP product are more likely to smoke light or ultra-light cigarettes, report more symptoms of nicotine dependence, smoke more cigarettes per day, report a higher number of quit attempts, and seek quitting assistance from pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapies compared with non-PREP users. DISCUSSION: These findings support the concern that current smokers who are highly dependent yet motivated to quit smoking may seek PREPs as an alternative strategy to smoking cessation.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19915081?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784491">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Preventive & Screening Services, Prevention, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Attitudes, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adult, Advertising as Topic, Aged, Attitude to Health, Consumer Behavior, epidemiology, Female, Health Promotion, Humans, Male, methods, Middle Aged, organization & administration, prevention & control, psychology, Questionnaires, Risk Factors, Risk Reduction Behavior, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Pesko MF, Kruger J, Hyland A, </td><td> <strong>Cigarette price minimization strategies used by adults.</strong> <br> Pesko MF, Kruger J, Hyland A, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2012 Sep <br> American journal of public health 102 (9) :e19-21 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal141">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal141" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Cigarette price minimization strategies used by adults.</strong> <br> Pesko MF, Kruger J, Hyland A, <br> Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 2012 Sep <br><p>We used multivariate logistic regressions to analyze data from the 2006 to 2007 Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey, a nationally representative sample of adults.

These vie with each other to influence the proportion of each generation who initiate smoking, the intensity level reached by smokers, and the time before smokers are able to quit successfully. This article provides a brief summary of the evidence associating tobacco marketing practices (organized under the four "Ps" of marketing), with smoking behavior. The evidence for causality in this association is considered convincing. Publicly funded, comprehensive, statewide tobacco-control programs were introduced into the United States in the late 1980s, with money either from tobacco taxes or from legal settlements of states with the tobacco industry. These programs use organized statewide approaches to implement current recommendations on "best practices" to discourage tobacco use, recommendations that have changed over time. During the 1990s, "best practices" evolved to include protection against secondhand smoke, sale of cigarettes to minors, and restrictions on tobacco advertising. Evaluations have been published on four statewide tobacco-control programs (Sydney/Melbourne, California, Massachusetts, and Florida) and a national program aimed at youth (American Legacy Program). For each program, there was a positive association with reduced smoking. The evidence supporting the conclusion that tobacco-control programs reduce smoking behavior is evaluated as strong.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18021907?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td> adverse effects, epidemiology, Health Behavior, Health Promotion, Humans, Marketing, methods, psychology, Public Policy, rehabilitation, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, State Government, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Pierce JP, Gilpin EA, Emery SL, White MM, Rosbrook B, Berry CC, Farkas AJ, </td><td> <strong>Has the California tobacco control program reduced smoking?</strong> <br> Pierce JP, Gilpin EA, Emery SL, White MM, Rosbrook B, Berry CC, Farkas AJ, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1998 Sep 9 <br> JAMA 280 (10) :893-9 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal143">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal143" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Has the California tobacco control program reduced smoking?</strong> <br> Pierce JP, Gilpin EA, Emery SL, White MM, Rosbrook B, Berry CC, Farkas AJ, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. <br> 1998 Sep 9 <br><p>CONTEXT: Comprehensive community-wide tobacco control programs are considered appropriate public health approaches to reduce population smoking prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in smoking behavior before, during, and after the California Tobacco Control Program. DESIGN: Per capita cigarette consumption data (1983-1997) were derived from tobacco industry sales figures. Adult (> or=18 years) smoking prevalence data were obtained from the National Health Interview Surveys (1978-1994), the California Tobacco Surveys (1990-1996), the Current Population Surveys (1992-1996), and the California Behavioral Risk Factor Survey and its supplement (1991-1997). Trends were compared before and after introduction of the program, with the period after the program being divided into 2 parts (early, 1989-1993; late, 1994-1996). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in cigarette consumption and smoking prevalence in California compared with the rest of the United States. RESULTS: Per capita cigarette consumption declined 52% faster in California in the early period than previously (from 9.7 packs per person per month at the beginning of the program to 6.5 packs per person per month in 1993), and the decline was significantly greater in California than in the rest of the United States (P&lt;.001). In the late period, the decline in California slowed to 28% of the early program so that in 1996 an average of 6.0 packs per person per month were consumed. No decline occurred in the rest of the United States, and in 1996, 10.5 packs per person per month were consumed. Smoking prevalence showed a similar pattern, but in the late period, there was no significant decline in prevalence in either California or the rest of the United States. In 1996, smoking prevalence was 18.0% in California and 22.4% in the rest of the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The initial effect of the program to reduce smoking in California did not persist. Possible reasons include reduced program funding, increased tobacco industry expenditures for advertising and promotion, and industry pricing and political activities. The question remains how the public health community can modify the program to regain its original momentum.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9739973?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Program Evaluation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> California, epidemiology, Humans, Prevalence, prevention & control, Program Evaluation, Regression Analysis, Smoking, State Government, Tobacco Industry, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Pierce JP, White MM, Gilpin EA, </td><td> <strong>Adolescent smoking decline during California's tobacco control programme.</strong> <br> Pierce JP, White MM, Gilpin EA, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2005 Jun <br> Tobacco control 14 (3) :207-12 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal144">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal144" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Adolescent smoking decline during California's tobacco control programme.</strong> <br> Pierce JP, White MM, Gilpin EA, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2005 Jun <br><p>OBJECTIVE: California's comprehensive tobacco control programme was 13 years old in 2002; by then, children entering adolescence at the start of the programme were young adults. This study examines whether adolescent smoking declined over this period, whether any decline carried through to young adulthood, and whether it was specific to California. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Most data were from the 1990-2002 California Tobacco Surveys (CTS) (adolescents 12-17 years, > 5000/survey, young adults 18-24 years, > 1000/survey). Additional data were from the national 1992/93-2001/02 Current Population Survey (CPS) (young adults 18-24 years, > 15,000/survey). RESULTS: Over the 13 year period in California, ever puffing declined by 70% in 12-13 year olds, by 53% in 14-15 year olds from 1992-2002, and by 34% in 16-17 year olds from 1996-2002 (CTS). As noted, the decline commenced progressively later in each older group. Smoking experimentation (1+ cigarettes) and established smoking (> 100 cigarettes in lifetime) showed similar patterns. Compared to 1990, the percentage of California young adults (CTS data) who ever experimented declined by 14%, with half of the decline from 1999-2002. CPS young adult smoking prevalence (established and now smoke everyday or some days) was constant in the rest of the USA over the entire period, but California showed a recent 18% decline from 1998/99 to 2001/02. CONCLUSIONS: California's comprehensive programme may have kept new adolescent cohorts from experimenting with cigarettes. Low young adolescent experimentation rates at programme start appeared to carry through to young adulthood, resulting in a recent drop in young adult smoking prevalence in California not observed in the rest of the USA.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15923472?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1748037">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Adult, Attitude to Health, California, Child, epidemiology, Health Behavior, Health Promotion, Health Surveys, Humans, Prevalence, prevention & control, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, trends, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Pierce JP, White MM, Messer K, </td><td> <strong>Changing age-specific patterns of cigarette consumption in the United States, 1992-2002: association with smoke-free homes and state-level tobacco control activity.</strong> <br> Pierce JP, White MM, Messer K, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2009 Feb <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 11 (2) :171-7 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal145">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal145" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Changing age-specific patterns of cigarette consumption in the United States, 1992-2002: association with smoke-free homes and state-level tobacco control activity.</strong> <br> Pierce JP, White MM, Messer K, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2009 Feb <br><p>INTRODUCTION: During the 1990s, both prevalence and average cigarette consumption declined in the United States, but age-specific changes have not been reported. METHOD: All four of the nationally and state representative U.S. Current Population Surveys-Tobacco Use Supplements from 1991-2002 (n=542,470) were analyzed for trends in cigarette consumption among smokers in three age groups: 18-29, 30-44, and 45-64 years. A strength of tobacco control index ranking state of residence was added and weighted logistic regression analyses undertaken. RESULTS: Over the decade, both prevalence and average consumption declined. Moderate-heavy smoking (> or=15 cigarettes/day [CPD]) prevalence fell strongly over the period in all three age groups. For those aged > or=30 years, this reduction was accompanied by a similar drop in total smoking prevalence. For those aged 18-29 years, this reduction was associated with an increase in very light smoking (&lt;5 CPD; 12% daily and 88% intermittent smokers) to 22.5% of current smokers with a much smaller reduction in prevalence. Smoke-free homes more than doubled in each age group and mediated the increase in very light smoking levels. Smoke-free workplaces and the strength of tobacco control in the state were also important predictors. Very light smoking was particularly prevalent among college students and graduates. DISCUSSION: The marked reduction in prevalence of moderate-heavy smoking across age groups should translate into a reduced population risk of smoking-related disease in the near term. That this reduction is offset by an increase in light and intermittent smoking in young adults suggests the effectiveness of tobacco industry marketing and needs further research.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19246423?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658899">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Data Collection, epidemiology, Female, Housing, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, Middle Aged, prevention & control, Smoking, State Government, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Plescia M, Malek SH, Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, </td><td> <strong>Protecting workers from secondhand smoke in North Carolina.</strong> <br> Plescia M, Malek SH, Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2005 May-Jun <br> North Carolina medical journal 66 (3) :186-91 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal146">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal146" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Protecting workers from secondhand smoke in North Carolina.</strong> <br> Plescia M, Malek SH, Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2005 May-Jun <br><p>BACKGROUND: Exposure to job-related secondhand smoke represents a significant, but entirely preventable occupational health risk to non-smoking workers. This article examines trends in smoke-free workplace policies in North Carolina. We also examine whether workers comply with such policies. METHODS: Data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey were analyzed from 1992 through 2002. Trends for North Carolina workers are compared with workers nationally and trends are presented by age, race, gender, and type of worker. RESULTS: North Carolina ranks 35th in the proportion of its workforce reporting a smoke-free place of employment. The proportion of workers reporting such a policy doubled between 1992 and 2002. Females were more likely to reporta smoke-free work environment (72.0%, CI +/- 2.6) than males (61.2%, CI +/- 4.6%). Blue-collar (55.6%, CI +/- 5.5) and service workers (61.2%, CI +/- 8.4), especially males, were less likely to report a smoke-free worksite than white-collar workers (73.4%, CI +/- 2.6). Compliance with a smoke-free policy does not appear to be an issue, only 3.2% of workers statewide reported someone had violated their company's nonsmoking policy CONCLUSION: While some progress has been made in North Carolina to protect workers from secondhand smoke, significant disparities exist. Smoke-free policies can make a significant difference in reducing exposure to airborne toxins and their associated diseases, and these protective public health policies have not been shown to reduce business revenues. Much has been done to assure the health and safety of workers through public health policy However, opportunities to protect North Carolina workers from the health effects of secondhand smoke are limited by a preemptive state law.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16130941?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, classification, Data Collection, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, North Carolina, Occupational Exposure, Occupational Health, Occupations, organization & administration, Organizational Policy, prevention & control, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Reed MB, Burns DM, </td><td> <strong>A population-based examination of racial and ethnic differences in receiving physicians' advice to quit smoking.</strong> <br> Reed MB, Burns DM, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Sep <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 10 (9) :1487-94 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal147">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal147" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>A population-based examination of racial and ethnic differences in receiving physicians' advice to quit smoking.</strong> <br> Reed MB, Burns DM, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Sep <br><p>We examined the rate of physician-delivered smoking cessation advice in the United States over time for five different racial/ethnic groups.

Results of a multivariate logistic regression showed no difference in the receipt of advice as a function of a smoker's race/ethnicity in any of the surveys, with the exception of 1998--1999, after controlling for factors such as smoker's gender, years of education, household income, and cigarettes smoked per day. In the 1998--1999 survey, Asian smokers were more likely to report receiving smoking cessation advice from a physician relative to non-Hispanic White smokers. With the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native smokers, the receipt of advice by each racial/ethnic group increased significantly from the 1992--1993 survey to the 1998--1999 survey, after controlling for gender, age, education, and cigarettes smoked per day. Because rates of advice for American Indian/Alaska Native smokers did not increase over time, specific public health interventions should be developed and integrated into medical settings serving smokers from American Indian/Alaska Native communities.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19023840?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Professional Advice, </td><td></td><td> Adult, African Americans, Aged, Asian Americans, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, ethnology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Health Behavior, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Indians, North American, Male, methods, Middle Aged, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Patient Education as Topic, Patient Participation, prevention & control, Professional-Patient Relations, Retrospective Studies, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Rivara FP, Ebel BE, Garrison MM, Christakis DA, Wiehe SE, Levy DT, </td><td> <strong>Prevention of smoking-related deaths in the United States.</strong> <br> Rivara FP, Ebel BE, Garrison MM, Christakis DA, Wiehe SE, Levy DT, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review <br> 2004 Aug <br> American journal of preventive medicine 27 (2) :118-25 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal148">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal148" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Prevention of smoking-related deaths in the United States.</strong> <br> Rivara FP, Ebel BE, Garrison MM, Christakis DA, Wiehe SE, Levy DT, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review <br> 2004 Aug <br><p>BACKGROUND: Tobacco is the leading cause of death in the United States. The majority of people who smoke begin before age 18. OBJECTIVE: Determine the number of smoking-attributable deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) in adults that might be saved through interventions to reduce smoking prevalence among children and adolescents. METHODS: Calculation of the smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost by age 85 among the cohort of people aged 18 in 2000. RESULTS: By age 85, there would be 127,670 smoking-attributable deaths among women and 284,502 deaths among men, for a total 412,172 smoking-attributable deaths in the United States among the cohort of 3,964,704 people aged 18 years alive in 2000. Through large-scale multimedia campaigns and a $1 increase in the price per pack of cigarettes, smoking prevalence could be reduced by 26% and would result in an annual savings of 108,466 lives and 1.6 million YPLL.

DESIGN: Secondary analyses using cross-sectional data from the 2006/2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. SUBJECTS: Nationally representative sample of 7610 U.S. employed female smokers, aged 18 to 64 years, who reported working indoors. Setting . N/A. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of smoking ban policies (complete work and home bans, complete work ban only, complete home ban only, and no complete work or home ban) with intention to quit in the next 30 days, at least one quit attempt in the past year, and sustained abstinence of at least 3 months in the past year. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of women reported complete work and home smoking bans. Smoking bans were not associated with intention to quit and were marginally associated with sustained abstinence. Regardless of intention to quit, women with complete work and home bans were significantly more likely than those without complete work and home bans to report quit attempts. Among women with no intention to quit, the odds of having a quit attempt were significantly higher among women who had a complete home ban only compared with women without complete work and home bans. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to promote quitting behaviors among employed female smokers may be facilitated by increasing rates of complete smoking bans at both work and home settings.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21879940?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, Female, Health Promotion, Health Services Research, Humans, Life Style, Logistic Models, methods, Middle Aged, Prevalence, prevention & control, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Social Marketing, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Disorder, United States, Workplace, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Sarna L, Bialous SA, Nandy K, Yang Q, </td><td> <strong>Are quit attempts among U.S. female nurses who smoke different from female smokers in the general population?

Examining smoking behaviors among occupational groups with a high prevalence of women may reveal the culture of smoking behavior and quit efforts of female smokers. The purpose of this study was to examine how smoking and quitting characteristics (i.e., ever and recent quit attempts) among females in the occupation of nursing are similar or different to those of women in the general population. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey 2006/2007 were used to compare smoking behaviors of nurses (n=2, 566) to those of non-healthcare professional women (n=93, 717). Smoking characteristics included years of smoking, number of cigarettes, and time to first cigarette with smoking within the first 30 minutes as an indicator of nicotine dependence. Logistic regression models using replicate weights were used to determine correlates of ever and previous 12 months quit attempts. RESULTS: Nurses had a lower smoking prevalence than other women (12.1% vs 16.6%, p &lt; 0.0001); were more likely to have ever made a quit attempt (77% vs 68%, p=0.0002); but not in the previous 12 months (42% vs 43%, p=0.77). Among those who ever made a quit attempt, nurses who smoked within 30 minutes of waking, were more likely to have made a quit attempt compared to other women (OR=3.1, 95% CI: 1.9, 5.1). When considering quit attempts within the last 12 months, nurses whose first cigarette was after 30 minutes of waking were less likely to have made a quit attempt compared to other females (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.98). There were no other significant differences in ever/recent quitting. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking prevalence among female nurses was lower than among women who were not in healthcare occupations, as expected. The lack of difference in recent quit efforts among female nurses as compared to other female smokers has not been previously reported. The link between lower level of nicotine dependence, as reflected by the longer time to first cigarette, and lower quit attempts among nurses needs further exploration.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22429917?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3328253">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, adverse effects, Age of Onset, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, Female, Humans, Logistic Models, Middle Aged, Nurses, Prevalence, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Time Factors, United States, Women's Health, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Sarna L, Bialous SA, Sinha K, Yang Q, Wewers ME, </td><td> <strong>Are health care providers still smoking?

This study reports smoking status changes among health care professionals using the Tobacco Use Supplement-Current Population Surveys (TUS-CPS). METHODS: TUS-CPS self-reported smoking status (current, former, and never) identified by occupation (physicians, physician assistants, registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], respiratory therapists, dentists, and dental hygienists), were analyzed for the 2003 (N=4,095) and 2006/2007 (N=3,976) cohorts. Quit ratios among U.S. health care professionals were calculated by dividing the number of former smokers by the number of ever-smokers using weighted estimates. RESULTS: In 2006/2007, LPNs (20.55%) and respiratory therapists (19.28%) had the highest smoking prevalence. Physicians (2.31%), dentists (3.01%), pharmacists (3.25%), and RNs (10.73%) had the lowest prevalence. Data from 2006/2007 indicate that physicians, pharmacists, dentists, and physician assistants had the highest quit ratios; all groups had quit ratios higher than the general public, except LPNs (.52 vs. .46, respectively). Current smoking varied by group but did not significantly decline from 2003 to 2006/2007. The majority of health care professionals were never-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that only 4 health care professional groups met the Healthy People 2010 goal of 12% smoking prevalence. LPNs were the only group with quit ratios lower than the general population. The lack of significant decline in smoking rates among health professionals was similar to the "flat" rate seen among adults in the United States. This is of concern as smoking among health care professionals limits their interventions with smokers and their involvement in tobacco control.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20937670?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adult, Attitude of Health Personnel, epidemiology, Female, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Health Personnel, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Population Surveillance, Prevalence, Primary Health Care, Questionnaires, Reproducibility of Results, Retrospective Studies, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Schauer GL, Malarcher AM, Babb SD, </td><td> <strong>Gradual Reduction of Cigarette Consumption as a Cessation Strategy: Prevalence, Correlates, and Relationship With Quitting.</strong> <br> Schauer GL, Malarcher AM, Babb SD, <br> JOURNAL ARTICLE <br> 2014 Sep 1 <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco : <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal152">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal152" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Gradual Reduction of Cigarette Consumption as a Cessation Strategy: Prevalence, Correlates, and Relationship With Quitting.</strong> <br> Schauer GL, Malarcher AM, Babb SD, <br> JOURNAL ARTICLE <br> 2014 Sep 1 <br><p>INTRODUCTION: Gradually reducing cigarette consumption is an approach used to quit smoking, but has not been widely studied at a population level. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and demographic characteristics of U.S. adult smokers who tried to reduce to quit, and the relationship between reducing and successful quitting. METHODS: Data came from 12,571 adults in the 2010-2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey who tried to quit smoking in the past year. Frequencies and percentages were used to assess prevalence of reducing to quit; bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess correlates of reducing to quit and successful past year cessation. Analyses were conducted in SAS-callable SUDAAN. RESULTS: Among adults who tried to quit smoking in the past year, 43.0% (n=5,444) tried reducing to quit. Compared to those who tried to quit without reducing consumption, those reducing to quit had a significantly higher prevalence of using counseling or medication (40.2% vs. 25.0%). In adjusted multivariable models, females (vs. males), Blacks (vs. Whites), current some day smokers (vs. every day smokers), and those who used counseling or medication had greater odds of trying to reduce to quit. Reducing to quit was negatively associated with successful past-year quitting (AOR=0.59, 95% CI=0.48, 0.72). CONCLUSION: Reducing to quit is a common cessation strategy and, in these analyses, was associated with lower cessation success rates.

Demographics and smoking characteristics were computed among those switching to SLT, switching to OCT, or trying to quit without using either strategy. Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression models identified correlates of using each strategy. RESULTS: Overall, 3.1% of smokers tried switching to SLT to quit, 2.2% tried switching to OCT, and 0.6% tried both strategies. Compared to those not using either switching strategy to try to quit, males were more likely than females to try switching to SLT or OCT; Blacks were less likely than Whites to try switching to SLT, but more likely to try switching to OCT; younger age groups were more likely to try switching to SLT or OCT; current someday smokers were more likely to have try switching to SLT (vs. everyday smokers), while recent former smokers were more likely to have tried switching to OCT. Both switching groups were more likely to have used cessation medication versus those not using switching strategies. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that switching to other tobacco products is a prevalent cessation approach; messages are needed to help clinicians encourage smokers who try to quit by switching to use evidence-based cessation approaches.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239959?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Other Tobacco Products, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Smokeless Tobacco, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Shaikh RA, Siahpush M, Singh GK, </td><td> <strong>Socioeconomic, demographic and smoking-related correlates of the use of potentially reduced exposure to tobacco products in a national sample.</strong> <br> Shaikh RA, Siahpush M, Singh GK, <br> Journal Article <br> 2014 Jul <br> Tobacco control 23 (4) :353-8 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal154">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal154" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Socioeconomic, demographic and smoking-related correlates of the use of potentially reduced exposure to tobacco products in a national sample.</strong> <br> Shaikh RA, Siahpush M, Singh GK, <br> Journal Article <br> 2014 Jul <br><p>BACKGROUND AND AIM: In recent years, new non-traditional, potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), claiming to contain fewer harmful chemicals than the traditional products, have been introduced in the market. Little is known about socioeconomic, demographic and smoking-related determinants of the likelihood of using these products among smokers. The aim of this study was to examine these determinants. METHODS: Data from the 2006-2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey was used. We limited the analysis to current smokers (n=40724). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association between covariates and the probability of the use of PREPs. RESULTS: We found that younger age, lower education, higher nicotine addiction and having an intention to quit are associated with higher likelihood of the use of PREPs. The likelihood of using these products was found to be higher among respondents who are unemployed or have a service, production, sales or farming occupation than those with a professional occupation. Smokers living in the midwest, south or west, were found to have a greater likelihood of the use of PREPs than those living in the northeast. CONCLUSIONS: Because there is little evidence to suggest that PREPs are less harmful that other tobacco products, their marketing as harm-minimising products should be regulated. Smokers, in particular those who are younger, have a lower socioeconomic status, and are more nicotine-dependent, should be the target of educational programmes that reveal the actual harm of PREPs.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291431?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Other Tobacco Products, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Shavers VL, Fagan P, Alexander LA, Clayton R, Doucet J, Baezconde-Garbanati L, </td><td> <strong>Workplace and home smoking restrictions and racial/ethnic variation in the prevalence and intensity of current cigarette smoking among women by poverty status, TUS-CPS 1998-1999 and 2001-2002.</strong> <br> Shavers VL, Fagan P, Alexander LA, Clayton R, Doucet J, Baezconde-Garbanati L, <br> Journal Article <br> 2006 Sep <br> Journal of epidemiology and community health 60 Suppl 2 :34-43 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal155">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal155" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Workplace and home smoking restrictions and racial/ethnic variation in the prevalence and intensity of current cigarette smoking among women by poverty status, TUS-CPS 1998-1999 and 2001-2002.</strong> <br> Shavers VL, Fagan P, Alexander LA, Clayton R, Doucet J, Baezconde-Garbanati L, <br> Journal Article <br> 2006 Sep <br><p>STUDY OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the health consequences of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke has led government agencies and many employers to establish policies that restrict cigarette smoking in public and workplaces. This cross sectional study examines the association of workplace smoking policies and home smoking restrictions with current smoking among women. DESIGN: Participants were employed US women ages 18-64 who were self respondents to the 1998-1999 or 2000-2001 tobacco use supplement to the current population survey supplements. Cross tabulations and multivariate logistic regression analyses examine the association of selected demographic characteristics, occupation, income, workplace and home smoking policies/restrictions with current smoking, consumption patterns, and quit attempts among women by poverty level for five race/ethnic groups. MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of either having an official workplace or home smoking policy that completely banned smoking increased with increased distance from the poverty level threshold. A complete ban on home smoking was more frequently reported by African American and Hispanic women although Hispanic women less frequently reported an official workplace smoking policy. In general, policies that permitted smoking in the work area or at home were associated with a higher prevalence of current smoking but this varied by poverty level and race/ethnicity. Home smoking policies that permitted smoking were associated with lower adjusted odds of having a least one quit attempt for nearly all poverty level categories but there was no association between having one quit attempt and workplace policies. CONCLUSION: Home smoking policies were more consistently associated with a lower prevalence of current smoking irrespective of poverty status or race/ethnicity than workplace policies. These findings underscore the importance of examining tobacco control policies in multiple domains (work and home) as well as by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17708009?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2491893">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Economics of Cancer, Health Disparities, Monitoring Risk Factors, Policy, Prevention, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Occupation, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Workplace Smoking Restrictions, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, ethnology, Female, Humans, organization & administration, Prevalence, prevention & control, Public Policy, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, United States, Women, Women, Working, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Shavers VL, Lawrence D, Fagan P, Gibson JT, </td><td> <strong>Racial/ethnic variation in cigarette smoking among the civilian US population by occupation and industry, TUS-CPS 1998-1999.</strong> <br> Shavers VL, Lawrence D, Fagan P, Gibson JT, <br> Journal Article <br> 2005 Aug <br> Preventive medicine 41 (2) :597-606 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal156">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal156" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Racial/ethnic variation in cigarette smoking among the civilian US population by occupation and industry, TUS-CPS 1998-1999.</strong> <br> Shavers VL, Lawrence D, Fagan P, Gibson JT, <br> Journal Article <br> 2005 Aug <br><p>BACKGROUND: Although observational research studies have shown variance in the prevalence of smoking among occupations and industries, few have examined the role of race/ethnicity. This study examined racial/ethnic variation in the prevalence of current smoking and cigarette consumption patterns by occupation, industry and workplace smoking policy. METHODS: Data were examined for 9095 African American (AA), 1025 American Indian/Alaska Native, 3463 Asian/Pacific Islander (AAPI), 8428 Hispanic, and 86,676 white participants in the 1998-1999 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Race-stratified multivariate logistic regression analyses, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA were used to examine the association between the covariates and smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption patterns. RESULTS: Current smoking prevalence ranged from a high of 35.1% for AI/AN to 15.2% for AAPI. Occupation was not significantly associated with current smoking for Hispanics, AI/ANs, and AAPIs while neither occupation nor industry was associated with current smoking among African Americans after adjustment for gender, age group, education, income, or workplace smoking policies. DISCUSSION: These data confirm results of previous studies that show occupation and industry variation in smoking prevalence and also highlight the importance of examining racial/ethnicity as a covariate in studies of smoking prevalence.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15917058?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Occupation, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, ethnology, Female, Humans, Industry, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Occupational Health, Occupations, Organizational Policy, Prevalence, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, United States, Workplace, </td></tr><tr><td> Shiffman S, Brockwell SE, Pillitteri JL, Gitchell JG, </td><td> <strong>Use of smoking-cessation treatments in the United States.</strong> <br> Shiffman S, Brockwell SE, Pillitteri JL, Gitchell JG, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Feb <br> American journal of preventive medicine 34 (2) :102-11 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal157">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal157" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Use of smoking-cessation treatments in the United States.</strong> <br> Shiffman S, Brockwell SE, Pillitteri JL, Gitchell JG, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Feb <br><p>BACKGROUND: Health promotion efforts encourage smokers to quit and to use effective cessation treatments. Randomized controlled trials demonstrate that medications and behavioral treatments improve cessation rates, but retrospective surveys have been inconsistent. This study assessed frequency of quit attempts, use of treatments for cessation, and abstinence rates among treatment users and non-users. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2003 Tobacco Use Special Cessation Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Participants included 29,537 U.S. smokers aged > or=18 years who smoked daily 12 months before the survey. Outcome measures included past-year quit attempts; use of behavioral, pharmacologic, and alternative treatments; receipt of social support; and abstinence for > or=4 weeks at time of survey. RESULTS: Approximately 43.5% of smokers reported a quit attempt in the preceding year: 64.2% of attempters used no cessation treatments; 8.8% used behavioral treatment; 32.2% used medication; and 14.1% used more than one treatment. Social support was reported to have been received by 24.1%. More nicotine-dependent smokers were more likely to use medications (OR=3.58; 95% CI=3.04-4.20). At the time of the survey, 19.3% of attempters were abstinent > or=4 weeks. Smokers who sought treatment were less likely to be abstinent (OR=0.75; 95% CI=0.67-0.84), and those who sought multiple treatments were even less likely to be abstinent. CONCLUSIONS: Many U.S. smokers make quit attempts, but most do not use behavioral or pharmacologic treatments. More nicotine-dependent smokers were more likely to seek treatment. Smokers who sought treatment were less likely to report abstinence, probably due to biased self-selection and recall. Retrospective survey data are not well-suited to assess the effectiveness of treatment.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18201639?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, methods, Middle Aged, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, therapy, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Shiffman S, Brockwell SE, Pillitteri JL, Gitchell JG, </td><td> <strong>Individual differences in adoption of treatment for smoking cessation: demographic and smoking history characteristics.</strong> <br> Shiffman S, Brockwell SE, Pillitteri JL, Gitchell JG, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Jan 11 <br> Drug and alcohol dependence 93 (1-2) :121-31 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal158">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal158" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Individual differences in adoption of treatment for smoking cessation: demographic and smoking history characteristics.</strong> <br> Shiffman S, Brockwell SE, Pillitteri JL, Gitchell JG, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Jan 11 <br><p>BACKGROUND: Behavioral and pharmacological treatments have been shown to improve smoking cessation rates, but treatments are under-utilized.

PARTICIPANTS: Representative sample of 12,027 U.S. daily smokers ages 18 and older who made a quit attempt in the past year. MEASUREMENTS: Use of behavioral, pharmacological or alternative treatments for cessation; demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, education and income) and measures of nicotine dependence. RESULTS: Females, Whites, older, more educated and wealthier smokers were more likely to adopt treatment in a quit attempt, as were more nicotine dependent smokers. Females were more likely than males to use behavioral treatments. Females and more educated smokers were more likely to combine behavioral and pharmacological treatment. Among those who used only one treatment, males, older and more nicotine dependent smokers were more likely to adopt pharmacological treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of smokers make quit attempts without the benefit of proven behavioral or pharmacological treatments.

DESIGN: Multivariate logistic regression analysis of major demographic variables and household composition characteristics. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: 128 024 employed female respondents to the Census Bureau's current population survey over the 10 year period 1992 to 2002. MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of smoke free homes has increased significantly over the past decade. This increase was evident across all demographic and household characteristics examined with the greatest rate of increase seen among smoking households. Nearly 90% of households consisting of all never smoking adult members reported having a smoke free home in 2001-02 compared with 22% of households consisting of all smokers. The extent of smoking restrictions in the home was the most powerful determinant of cessation of all the factors examined in the regression model. Odds of becoming a former smoker (any length) and quit for three months or more were seven to eight times greater among those women reporting their homes were smoke free compared with those whose homes permitted smoking anywhere in the home. CONCLUSIONS: Smoke free homes were associated with a highly significant increase in quitting (p&lt;0.0001). However, at this time it is not clear what proportion of the observed effect can be attributed to living in a smoke free home. None the less, the significantly increased probability of quitting correlated with having a smoke free home found in this analysis, are substantially higher than the odds reported in most workplace studies published to date; additional studies are needed to elucidate this relation.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17708010?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2491887">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Aged, epidemiology, Family Characteristics, Female, Humans, Logistic Models, Middle Aged, Odds Ratio, Prevalence, prevention & control, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, United States, Women, Working, </td></tr><tr><td> Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, Gerlach KK, </td><td> <strong>Disparities in smoke-free workplace policies among food service workers.</strong> <br> Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, Gerlach KK, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Apr <br> Journal of occupational and environmental medicine / American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine 46 (4) :347-56 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal161">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal161" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Disparities in smoke-free workplace policies among food service workers.</strong> <br> Shopland DR, Anderson CM, Burns DM, Gerlach KK, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Apr <br><p>Information is lacking on which groups of workers are protected from job-related environmental tobacco smoke.

Few sources exist in the peer-reviewed literature documenting state and regional differences in smoking behavior, despite the fact that cancer prevention and control efforts are increasingly being implemented below the national level. PURPOSE: Our goals were to determine smoking prevalence rates among men and women, by region, and for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia from census survey data collected in 1992 and 1993 and to compare these rates with rates determined in 1985. METHODS: Every month, the U.S. Bureau of the Census collects labor force statistics on more than 100000 individuals on its Current Population Survey (CPS). For the September 1992, January 1993, and May 1993 CPS, the National Cancer Institute sponsored a 40-item Tobacco Use Supplement. The definition of a current smoker changed slightly between 1985 and 1992-1993. For the 1985 CPS, individuals were considered current smokers if they had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and were smoking at the time of interview; for the 1992-1993 CPS, current smokers included anyone who had smoked 100 cigarettes and was currently smoking every day or just on some days. We calculated current smoking rates (every day and some days combined) based on more than a quarter million adults (n=266988) interviewed in 1992-1993. RESULTS: Substantial geographic variation exists in rates of current cigarette use among adults within the United States. In general, adults in the southern United States have higher rates of smoking and adults in the western states have lower rates of smoking and adults in the rest of the country, although differences in smoking behavior between men and women and among various racial and ethnic populations strongly influence these patterns. Only two states, Kentucky and West Virginia, exhibited adult smoking rates (men and women combined) of 30% or higher in 1992-1993; in contrast, in 1985, such rates were reported from 20 states. The only states in which the prevalence was below 20% in 1992-1993 were Utah (17.1%) and California (19.5%). Rates approaching 20% were reported from New Jersey (20.7%), Massachusetts (21.5%), and Nebraska, New York, and Hawaii (22.0% each) in 1992-1993. Rhode Island experienced the greatest relative decline in smoking prevalence from 1985 to 1992-1993, with a calculated relative change of -30.7% (based on a change in rate from 33.5% to 23.2%), followed by Delaware (-25.9%) the District of Columbia and New Jersey (-23.9% each), Connecticut (-23.2%), California (-22.9%), Alaska (-22.8%), Georgia (-22.6%), Massachusetts (-22.1%), and New York (-22.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking rates are not uniform in the United States but vary considerably from state to state, even within the same region of the country. The CPS is the only mechanism currently capable of simultaneously monitoring smoking trends nationally, regionally, and on a state-by-state basis.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8944005?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Age Distribution, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, ethnology, Female, Humans, Male, Occupations, Population Surveillance, Prevalence, Sex Distribution, Smoking, statistics & numerical data, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Repace JL, Lynn WR, </td><td> <strong>Smoking behavior, workplace policies, and public opinion regarding smoking restrictions in Maryland.</strong> <br> Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Repace JL, Lynn WR, <br> Journal Article <br> 1995 Feb <br> Maryland medical journal (Baltimore, Md. : 1985) 44 (2) :99-104 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal164">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal164" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Smoking behavior, workplace policies, and public opinion regarding smoking restrictions in Maryland.</strong> <br> Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Repace JL, Lynn WR, <br> Journal Article <br> 1995 Feb <br><p>The Maryland Occupational Safety and Health (MOSH) advisory board recently proposed a smoking ban in most Maryland workplaces, including bars and restaurants, unless smoking is restricted to a separately ventilated area where nonsmoking workers cannot be required to enter.

The goal of this research was to examine these variations. METHODS: Data came from the 2003, 2006 and 2007 Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey. The analysis was limited to ever-smokers (n=117,168). The outcome was number of years of daily smoking. Survival analysis was employed to predict smoking duration. RESULTS: American Indians with 32 years had the highest median duration of smoking, followed by Blacks and 'other' races with 30 years, Whites with 28 years and Hispanics with 24 years. The difference in the duration of smoking between Blacks and Whites disappeared after adjusting for poverty. Individuals in poverty had a median duration of smoking of 40 years, while those with a family income of at least three times that of the poverty threshold had a median duration of 22 years. Median duration of smoking was 40 years among individuals without a high-school diploma and 18 years among those with a bachelors or higher degree. CONCLUSION: This research revealed large variations in smoking duration between racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Longer exposure to tobacco among groups that are already disadvantaged is likely to exacerbate existing health disparities.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892784?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Continental Population Groups, Educational Status, epidemiology, ethnology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Occupations, Questionnaires, Regression Analysis, Smoking, Social Class, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Sindelar JL, Duchovny N, Falba TA, Busch SH, </td><td> <strong>If smoking increases absences, does quitting reduce them?</strong> <br> Sindelar JL, Duchovny N, Falba TA, Busch SH, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2005 Apr <br> Tobacco control 14 (2) :99-105 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal166">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal166" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>If smoking increases absences, does quitting reduce them?</strong> <br> Sindelar JL, Duchovny N, Falba TA, Busch SH, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2005 Apr <br><p>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of smoking, quitting, and time since quit on absences from work. METHODS: Data from the nationally representative Tobacco Use Supplements of the 1992/93, 1995/96, and 1998/99 Current Population Surveys were used. The study included full time workers aged between 18-64 years, yielding a sample size of 383 778 workers. A binary indicator of absence due to sickness in the last week was analysed as a function of smoking status including time since quit for former smokers. Extensive demographic variables were included as controls in all models. RESULTS: In initial comparisons between current and former smokers, smoking increased absences, but quitting did not reduce them. However, when length of time since quit was examined, it was discovered that those who quit within the last year, and especially the last three months, had a much greater probability of absences than did current smokers. As the time since quitting increased, absences returned to a rate somewhere between that of never and current smokers. Interactions between health and smoking status significantly improved the fit of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers who quit reduced their absences over time but increase their absences immediately after quitting. Quitting ill may account for some but not all of this short run impact.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15791019?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1747999">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Occupation, </td><td></td><td> Absenteeism, Adolescent, Adult, epidemiology, Female, Health Status, Humans, Male, methods, Middle Aged, Odds Ratio, Population Surveillance, psychology, Regression Analysis, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Time Factors, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Singh GK, Siahpush M, Kogan MD, </td><td> <strong>Disparities in children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the United States, 2007.</strong> <br> Singh GK, Siahpush M, Kogan MD, <br> Journal Article <br> 2010 Jul <br> Pediatrics 126 (1) :4-13 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal167">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal167" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Disparities in children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the United States, 2007.</strong> <br> Singh GK, Siahpush M, Kogan MD, <br> Journal Article <br> 2010 Jul <br><p>OBJECTIVES: This study examined racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or secondhand smoke in the home. METHODS: The 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (N=90,853) was used to calculate the prevalence of children's exposure to ETS. State-level data on home smoking ban from the 2006-2007 Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement were used to supplement analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds of exposure. RESULTS: In 2007, 7.6% of US children, or 5.5 million children, lived in households where someone smoked inside the home. The prevalence varied from a low of 1.1% for Utah and 1.9% for California to a high of 17.9% for West Virginia and 17.6% in Kentucky. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, children in Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania had 12 times higher odds and those in Wisconsin, Missouri, Delaware, and the District of Columbia had 10 times higher odds of being exposed to ETS than children in Utah. Compared with children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, Hispanic ethnicity, and non-English-speaking households, children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds had 7.3 to 10.6 times higher adjusted odds; non-Hispanic white, black, American Indian, and mixed-race children had 2.0 to 2.6 times higher odds; and children from English-speaking households had 4.1 times higher odds of ETS exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable disparities exist in children's exposure to ETS, with geographic pattern strongly related to home smoking ban. Greater exposure to ETS among children in several states and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups is likely to exacerbate existing health disparities.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20587673?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, adverse effects, Age Factors, Child, Child Welfare, Child, Preschool, Confidence Intervals, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, Family Characteristics, Female, Health Status Disparities, Humans, Infant, Male, Needs Assessment, Prevalence, prevention & control, Probability, Risk Assessment, Sex Factors, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Smith KC, Siebel C, Pham L, Cho J, Singer RF, Chaloupka FJ, Griswold M, Wakefield M, </td><td> <strong>News on tobacco and public attitudes toward smokefree air policies in the United States.</strong> <br> Smith KC, Siebel C, Pham L, Cho J, Singer RF, Chaloupka FJ, Griswold M, Wakefield M, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Apr <br> Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands) 86 (1) :42-52 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal168">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal168" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>News on tobacco and public attitudes toward smokefree air policies in the United States.</strong> <br> Smith KC, Siebel C, Pham L, Cho J, Singer RF, Chaloupka FJ, Griswold M, Wakefield M, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2008 Apr <br><p>OBJECTIVES: Smoking bans are a central component of comprehensive tobacco control programs, and an increasing number of states and localities have adopted them. Public support is critical as efforts continue to extend protection from secondhand smoke to all. We examine the relationship between state print news coverage of tobacco and public sentiment towards smoking bans. METHODS: We utilize two data sources: the February 2002 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement, and articles from 2 months in a database comprised of content-analyzed newspaper articles on tobacco from all daily U.S. newspapers. We control for demographic and state-level tobacco covariates, and use logistic regression to identify associations between news coverage and attitudes towards policy initiatives by smoking status. RESULTS: We find no association between tone of news coverage and any outcome measure and little evidence of a relationship between the volume of overall tobacco news and attitudes towards smoking bans. Our data suggest that people exposed to more news on secondhand smoke issues are less likely to support restaurant smoking bans. Higher volume of secondhand smoke news is also predictive of lower support for bar bans among recent quitters. Support for hospital bans is, however, largely independent of news coverage. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest two alternate explanations for our findings. First, for certain people, greater news volume on secondhand smoke may lead to lower support for bans. Alternatively, secondhand smoke may be more newsworthy in states where bans are more controversial.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17983683?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Data Collection, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Policy Making, prevention & control, Public Opinion, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Snyder A, Falba T, Busch S, Sindelar J, </td><td> <strong>Are State legislatures responding to public opinion when allocating funds for tobacco control programs?</strong> <br> Snyder A, Falba T, Busch S, Sindelar J, <br> Journal Article <br> 2004 Jul <br> Health promotion practice 5 (3 Suppl) :35S-45S <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal169">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal169" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Are State legislatures responding to public opinion when allocating funds for tobacco control programs?</strong> <br> Snyder A, Falba T, Busch S, Sindelar J, <br> Journal Article <br> 2004 Jul <br><p>This study explored the factors associated with state-level allocations to tobacco-control programs.

Significant associations were found between our outcome, state-level tobacco-control funding per capita, and key variables of interest including public opinion, amount of tobacco settlement received, the party affiliation of the governor, the state's smoking rate, excise tax revenue received, and whether the state was a major producer of tobacco. The findings from this study supported our hypothesis that states with citizens who favor more restrictive indoor air policies allocate more to tobacco control.

We used a multiple logistic regression analysis with replicate weights to model the current smoking status logit as a function of a number of covariates. The final model included individual- and family-level sociodemographic characteristics, survey attributes, and multiple two-way interactions of survey mode and respondent type with other covariates. The respondent type is a significant predictor of current smoking prevalence and the magnitude of the difference depends on the age, sex, and education of the person whose smoking status is being reported. Furthermore, the survey mode has significant interactions with survey year, sex, and age. We conclude that using an overall unadjusted estimate of the current smoking prevalence may result in underestimating the current smoking rate when conducting proxy or telephone interviews especially for some sub-populations, such as young adults. We propose that estimates could be improved if more detailed information regarding the respondent type and survey administration mode characteristics were considered in addition to commonly used survey year and sociodemographic characteristics. This information is critical given that future surveillance is moving toward more complex designs. Thus, adjustment of estimates should be contemplated when comparing current smoking prevalence results within a given survey series with major changes in methodology over time and between different surveys using various modes and respondent types.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21841957?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153871">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Research Methodology, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Modeling, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Soulakova JN, Hartman AM, Liu B, Willis GB, Augustine S, </td><td> <strong>Reliability of adult self-reported smoking history: data from the tobacco use supplement to the current population survey 2002-2003 cohort.</strong> <br> Soulakova JN, Hartman AM, Liu B, Willis GB, Augustine S, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural <br> 2012 Aug <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 14 (8) :952-60 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal172">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal172" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Reliability of adult self-reported smoking history: data from the tobacco use supplement to the current population survey 2002-2003 cohort.</strong> <br> Soulakova JN, Hartman AM, Liu B, Willis GB, Augustine S, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural <br> 2012 Aug <br><p>INTRODUCTION: This study examined the reliability of self-reported smoking history measures. The key measures of interest were time since completely quitting smoking among former smokers; age at which fairly regular smoking was initiated among former and current smokers; the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years of daily smoking among former smokers; and never smoking. Another goal was to examine sociodemographic factors and interview method as potential predictors of the odds of strict agreement in responses. METHODS: Data from the 2002-2003 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey were examined. Descriptive analysis was performed to detect discrepant data patterns, and intraclass and Pearson correlations and kappa coefficients were used to assess reporting consistency over the 12-month interval. Multiple logistic regression models with replicate weights were built and fitted to identify factors influencing the logit of agreement for each measure of interest. RESULTS: All measures revealed at least moderate levels of overall agreement. However, upon closer examination, a few measures also showed some considerable differences in absolute value. The highest percentage of these differences was observed for former smokers' reports of the number of years smoking every day. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data suggest that self-reported smoking history characteristics are reliable. The logit of agreement over a 12-month period is shown to depend on a few sociodemographic characteristics as well as their interactions with each other and with interview method.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318688?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3439867">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Cognitive Methods in Survey Research, Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Research Methodology, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, Tobacco - Smoking Initiation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cohort Studies, Demography, epidemiology, Female, Humans, Interviews as Topic, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Self Report, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Products, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Stillman F, Hartman A, Graubard B, Gilpin E, Chavis D, Garcia J, Wun LM, Lynn L, Manley M, </td><td> <strong>The American Stop Smoking Intervention Study.

To evaluate ASSIST, we compared changes in adult smoking prevalence, per capita cigarette consumption, and tobacco control policies between the 17 ASSIST states and the 33 non-ASSIST states and the District of Columbia. METHODS: The strength of tobacco control index was used to measure state-level program elements directed at tobacco control, and the initial outcomes index (IOI) was used to measure states' tobacco control policy outcomes. Prevalence data were obtained from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, and consumption data were obtained from the Tobacco Institute's bimonthly sales figures for cigarette packs moved from wholesale warehouses. Two-stage regression and mixed-effects linear modeling were used to analyze the various outcomes. Statistical analyses for testing individual regression coefficients were one-sided. RESULTS: ASSIST states had a greater decrease in adult smoking prevalence than non-ASSIST states, with an adjusted difference of -0.63% (P=.049). Per capita cigarette consumption was not statistically significantly different between ASSIST and non-ASSIST states. However, an increase in the IOI of a state from the 25th to the 75th percentile was associated with a reduction in per capita cigarette consumption by 0.57 packs per person per month. State IOI was also inversely, albeit not statistically significantly, associated with smoking prevalence (regression coefficient=-0.11;P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in adult smoking prevalence associated with ASSIST could have translated into approximately 278 700 fewer smokers nationwide if all states had implemented ASSIST.

Nevertheless, intervention and follow-up studies of smoking cessation treatments generally indicate no differences in quitting success among menthol compared to non-menthol smokers, while cross-sectional studies suggest some differences within race/ethnicity groups. The association between menthol cigarette use and likelihood of being a former versus current smoker was examined based on data from the National Health Interview Survey and Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Analyses stratified by race/ethnicity and limited to smokers who had quit at least one year prior to survey participation provided inconsistent results with regard to menthol cigarette use and quitting, both within surveys (i.e., comparing race/ethnicity groups) and between surveys (i.e., same race/ethnicity group across surveys). Evidence suggesting the existence or direction of an association between menthol in cigarettes and quitting depended on the data source.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25017361?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Sweeney CT, Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Anderson CM, Gower KB, Burns DM, </td><td> <strong>Sex differences in workplace smoking policies: results from the current population survey.</strong> <br> Sweeney CT, Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Anderson CM, Gower KB, Burns DM, <br> Journal Article <br> 2000 Fall <br> Journal of the American Medical Women's Association (1972) 55 (5) :311-5 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal176">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal176" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Sex differences in workplace smoking policies: results from the current population survey.</strong> <br> Sweeney CT, Shopland DR, Hartman AM, Gibson JT, Anderson CM, Gower KB, Burns DM, <br> Journal Article <br> 2000 Fall <br><p>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of smoking policies in indoor work environments in the United States, with a special focus on sex differences in the provision of these policies. METHOD: Information on the prevalence and restrictiveness of workplace smoking policies was obtained from 86,490 currently employed indoor workers (50,865 women and 35,625 men) 15 years of age and older who responded to the National Cancer Institute's Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, a cross-sectional survey of households in all 50 states and the District of Columbia conducted between 1995 and 1996. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of respondents reported that their workplaces had official smoking policies, and 63% reported that their workplaces were smoke free. Women reported significantly higher rates of both official smoking policies and smoke-free workplaces than men, regardless of racial/ethnic or age group. CONCLUSION: The overall rates of worksite smoking restrictions, including the establishment of smoke-free workplaces, were higher than those reported in earlier surveys.

Research is scarce on CTCP's impact on overall smoking cessation in California. METHODS: Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) data from 1992-1993 to 2006-2007 was used to create a cessation-related outcome index (CROI), which was a summarised z score of the following determinants: plan to quit, quit attempt and recent quit rate for each of the 50 US states. CROI trends over the period of six separate TUS-CPSs were plotted for California and other comparison states, for 18-34 year olds and for those 35 years or older separately in the context of historical cigarette price z score trend. RESULTS: California had a consistently high CROI for both age groups. The CROI trend line increased moderately in California for both age groups despite a declining cigarette price z score trend. In contrast, other selected states with a declining cigarette price z score trend had a declining CROI trend for both age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of CROI in California while cigarette price z score trend declined suggests that the implementation of CTCP, even without a significant direct cessation component, has had a profound impact on cessation outcomes.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20382652?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2976490">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Methods for Assessing Risk Factors, Preventive & Screening Services, Prevention, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Program Evaluation, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, California, Costs and Cost Analysis, Culture, economics, epidemiology, Health Promotion, Humans, prevention & control, Program Evaluation, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, Social Environment, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Use Disorder, trends, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Tauras JA, Levy D, Chaloupka FJ, Villanti A, Niaura RS, Vallone D, Abrams DB, </td><td> <strong>Menthol and non-menthol smoking: the impact of prices and smoke-free air laws.</strong> <br> Tauras JA, Levy D, Chaloupka FJ, Villanti A, Niaura RS, Vallone D, Abrams DB, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Dec <br> Addiction (Abingdon, England) 105 Suppl 1 :115-23 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal178">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal178" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Menthol and non-menthol smoking: the impact of prices and smoke-free air laws.</strong> <br> Tauras JA, Levy D, Chaloupka FJ, Villanti A, Niaura RS, Vallone D, Abrams DB, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Dec <br><p>AIMS: To examine the relationship between menthol and non-menthol prices and smoke-free air laws and the choice between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes among current smokers. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were extracted from the nationally representative (USA) 2003 and 2006/07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. A total of 57,383 adult smokers (aged 18+) were examined. MEASUREMENTS: A regression model was used to estimate the probability of being a menthol smoker conditional on being a current smoker who had a distinct preference for either non-menthol or menthol cigarettes. Cigarette prices, smoke-free air laws and socio-economic and demographic characteristics were examined as covariates. FINDINGS: The prices of menthol and non-menthol cigarettes were associated with the choice between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes. However, smokers did not find menthol and non-menthol cigarettes to be close substitutes for one another. Non-menthol cigarettes were found to be less of a substitute for menthol cigarettes than vice versa. Young adults and African Americans were less responsive to prices with respect to switching between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes than were older adults and non-African Americans, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is grappling with the issue of whether or not to ban menthol cigarettes. The findings from this study suggest that smokers do not find menthol and non-menthol cigarettes to be close substitutes. The strong preference for mentholated cigarettes may serve as a lever to reduce smoking prevalence when combined with increased access to effective cessation treatments.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059142?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Adolescent & Young Adult, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, African Americans, Choice Behavior, Commerce, economics, Epidemiologic Methods, epidemiology, Female, Humans, legislation & jurisprudence, Male, Menthol, Middle Aged, prevention & control, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Industry, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Tauras JA, Liang L, </td><td> <strong>The Impact of Physician Intervention and Tobacco Control Policies on Average Daily Cigarette Consumption Among Adult Smokers</strong> <br> Tauras JA, Liang L, <br><br> 2003 Jun <br><br> <br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal179">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal179" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The Impact of Physician Intervention and Tobacco Control Policies on Average Daily Cigarette Consumption Among Adult Smokers</strong> <br> Tauras JA, Liang L, <br><br> 2003 Jun <br><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w9790" target="_blank">Visit this publication's Web page</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Health Professional Advice, </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Tauras John A, </td><td> <strong>Smoke-free air laws, cigarette prices, and adult cigarette demand</strong> <br> Tauras John A, <br><br> 2006 Apr 9 <br> Economic inquiry 44 (2) :333-42 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal180">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal180" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Smoke-free air laws, cigarette prices, and adult cigarette demand</strong> <br> Tauras John A, <br><br> 2006 Apr 9 <br><p>This article examines the impact of cigarette prices and smoke-free air laws on adult smoking. Probit methods and a generalized linear model with log-link and Gaussian distribution are employed to model adult smoking propensity and intensity, respectively. After controlling for unobserved state-level heterogeneity, which can influence both tobacco policy and smoking behavior, the estimates from this study imply that an inverse relationship exists between cigarette prices and both smoking prevalence and average cigarette consumption by adult smokers. The estimates also imply that more restrictive smoke-free air laws decrease average smoking by adult smokers but have little impact on prevalence.

We assessed factors associated with switching and the association between switching and (1) making a quit attempt, and (2) recent quitting, yielding a measure of net quitting (attempts x recent quitting). DESIGN: In 2003, a total of 30 800 ever-smokers who smoked in the past year provided history of switching and 3 reasons for switching: harm reduction, quitting smoking and flavour. Among those who made a past-year quit attempt, recent quitting was defined as >or=90-day abstinence when surveyed. Multivariable logistic regression identified determinants of outcomes. RESULTS: In all, 12 009 (38%) of ever-smokers switched. Among switchers, the most commonly cited reasons were flavour only (26%) and all 3 reasons (18%). Switchers (vs non-switchers) were more likely to make a quit attempt between 2002 and 2003 (51% vs 41%, p&lt;0.001, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.58, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 1.69)), but less likely to have recently quit (9% vs 17%, p&lt;0.001; AOR 0.40 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.45)), yielding lower overall net quitting (4.3% vs 7.0%, p&lt;0.001; AOR 0.54, (95% CI 0.47 to 0.61)). The effects of switching on outcomes were most pronounced for reasons including quitting smoking, whereas switching for harm reduction alone had no association with outcomes. CONCLUSION: Compared with no switching, a history of switching was associated with 46% lower odds of net quitting.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892697?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901843">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Attitudes, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, adverse effects, Age Factors, Educational Status, epidemiology, Female, Harm Reduction, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, prevention & control, Sex Factors, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Trinidad DR, Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>Do the majority of Asian-American and African-American smokers start as adults?</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Feb <br> American journal of preventive medicine 26 (2) :156-8 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal182">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal182" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Do the majority of Asian-American and African-American smokers start as adults?</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2004 Feb <br><p>BACKGROUND: Identifying ethnic differences in the age of smoking onset from nationally representative data can lead to improved targeted prevention programs and policies to combat smoking in ethnic communities. METHODS: Analyzing data from the Tobacco Use Supplements of the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Surveys throughout the 1990s, differences in the age of regular smoking onset among Asians/Pacific Islanders (A/PI), African Americans (AA), Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) and non-Hispanic whites (WH) are reported. Data on people aged 26 to 50 years at the time of the survey interview (n=130,356; mean age=38.4 years; 47.9% male; 1.9% A/PI, 7.8% AA, 5.2% H/L, and 85.1% WH) were examined. RESULTS: Results indicate significant ethnic disparities in when people start smoking, among A/PIs in particular, and AAs and H/Ls to a lesser degree, who initiate regular smoking at later ages than do WHs. The majority of A/PIs and AAs initiated smoking as young adults, with almost half (47.8%) of A/PIs who were ever regular smokers starting between ages 18 and 21, compared with 39.8% of AAs, 37.5% of H/Ls, and 36.7% of WHs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate significant ethnic disparities in relation to when people start smoking, with the majority of A/PIs and AAs initiating as young adults. The findings suggest that prevention strategies should begin at a young age and continue throughout young adulthood, especially among ethnic minority populations. Further consideration of the different influences on later initiation in ethnic minorities may lead to suggestions to improve current smoking-prevention programs aimed at adolescents and young adults.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14751329?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Monitoring Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Adult, African Americans, Age Factors, Age of Onset, Asian Americans, epidemiology, ethnology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Health Surveys, Hispanic Americans, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, prevention & control, psychology, Smoking, statistics & numerical data, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Trinidad DR, Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>Has there been a delay in the age of regular smoking onset among African Americans?</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article <br> 2004 Dec <br> Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine 28 (3) :152-7 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal183">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal183" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Has there been a delay in the age of regular smoking onset among African Americans?</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Gilpin EA, Lee L, Pierce JP, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article <br> 2004 Dec <br><p>BACKGROUND: It is not clear whether the decline in African American adolescent smoking in the 1980s reflected a delay in age of onset of regular smoking initiation rather than success in preventing initiation completely. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to identify whether the marked reductions in African American adolescent smoking in the 1980s were offset by increased initiation in young adults. METHODS: We combined data from the Tobacco Use Supplements of the 1992-1993, 1995-1996, and 1998-1999 Current Population Surveys (n=512,258), and reconstructed year of smoking initiation and calculated age-specific incidence of initiation from 1970 to 1992. We then compared detailed age-specific rates of initiation for two 5-year periods selected to be before and after the documented large declines in African American adolescent smoking. RESULTS: In the time period after marked declines in African American adolescent smoking (1987-1991), the incidence of initiation of regular smoking decreased for African Americans ages 14 to 16 and increased for ages 18 to 20. Such a delay was not as evident among non-Hispanic Whites. The delay that was slight in regular smoking initiation among African Americans relative to non-Hispanic Whites in 1975-79 had increased substantially by 1987-91. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in African American adolescent smoking in the 1980s were offset by increased initiation among young adults ages 18 to 20 during this time period and suggest that the window for uptake of regular smoking shifted to older ages for African Americans more so than non-Hispanic Whites. Efforts to combat smoking should remain aggressive into young adulthood, when the tobacco industry's efforts to gain new smokers intensify.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15576252?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, African Americans, Age Factors, ethnology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Humans, Male, Smoking, trends, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Trinidad DR, Messer K, Gilpin EA, Al-Delaimy WK, White MM, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>The California Tobacco Control Program's effect on adult smokers: (3) Similar effects for African Americans across states.</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Messer K, Gilpin EA, Al-Delaimy WK, White MM, Pierce JP, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2007 Apr <br> Tobacco control 16 (2) :96-100 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal184">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal184" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The California Tobacco Control Program's effect on adult smokers: (3) Similar effects for African Americans across states.</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Messer K, Gilpin EA, Al-Delaimy WK, White MM, Pierce JP, <br> Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2007 Apr <br><p>OBJECTIVE: To compare trends in African-American (AA) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) smoking between states categorised as having three different levels of tobacco control practice in the 1990s.

RESULTS: From 1992-3 to 2001-2, there were large declines in AA smoking across states (2.7-3.8% decrease/year, adjusted for age, income, education, gender; p&lt;0.05). Adjusted NHW smoking prevalence declined significantly only in CA. AA prevalence declined significantly and did not differ across state groups. In all years, in all state groups, adjusted prevalence was either not significantly different or was lower for AAs than for NHWs. More recent cohorts of AAs appeared to have taken up smoking at lower rates than older cohorts. CONCLUSION: There were uniformly large declines in AA smoking from 1992-3 to 2001-2 across states, independent of type of tobacco control strategy.

These analyses would be informative in guiding targeted cessation strategies. METHODS: Using logistic regression models controlling for age, gender, and education, we examined the prevalence of intermittent and light daily consumption among current smokers across racial/ethnic groups from the 2003 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. We also examined the association of these demographic factors with consumption within each racial/ethnic group separately. RESULTS: Black (odds ratio [OR]=1.82, 95% CI=1.59-2.07), Asian/Pacific Islander (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.29-2.04), and Hispanic/Latino (OR=3.2, 95% CI=2.75-3.74) smokers were more likely to smoke intermittently compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Black (OR=2.69, 95% CI=2.27-3.18), Asian/Pacific Islander (OR=2.99, 95% CI=2.13-4.19), and Hispanic/Latino (OR=4.64, 95% CI=3.85-5.58) smokers also were more likely to have light daily consumption compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanic/Latino intermittent smokers smoked fewer days per month and fewer cigarettes per day compared with non-Hispanic White smokers. We found no significant gender differences across racial/ethnic groups in intermittent smoking, but male smokers were significantly less likely to have light daily consumption for all racial/ethnic groups. DISCUSSION: These results have implications for the understanding of the tobacco dependence, the development of prevention and cessation strategies, and the applicability of harm-reduction techniques for racial/ethnic minorities.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19246433?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658897">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Continental Population Groups, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, ethnology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Smoking, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Trinidad DR, Pérez-Stable EJ, Messer K, White MM, Pierce JP, </td><td> <strong>Menthol cigarettes and smoking cessation among racial/ethnic groups in the United States.</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Pérez-Stable EJ, Messer K, White MM, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Dec <br> Addiction (Abingdon, England) 105 Suppl 1 :84-94 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal186">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal186" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Menthol cigarettes and smoking cessation among racial/ethnic groups in the United States.</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Pérez-Stable EJ, Messer K, White MM, Pierce JP, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2010 Dec <br><p>AIM: To examine the association between smoking mentholated cigarettes and smoking cessation, separately for different racial/ethnic groups. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of the 2003 and 2006-07 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, non-Hispanic white adults. MEASUREMENTS: Examined relations between the use of mentholated cigarettes and measures of smoking cessation. FINDINGS: Among African Americans (ORadj=1.62, 95% CI: 1.35-1.95) and Hispanics/Latinos (ORadj=1.21, 95% CI: 1.00-1.47), those who currently smoked mentholated cigarettes were more likely be seriously considering quitting in the next six months than were non-menthol smokers, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. African Americans (ORadj=1.87, 95% CI: 1.60-2.19) and Hispanics/Latinos (ORadj=1.34, 95% CI: 1.11-1.62) who smoked mentholated cigarettes were also significantly more likely to have a positive estimation of successfully quitting in the next six months compared to non-menthol smokers. These associations were not found among Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, Native Americans/Alaska Natives and Non-Hispanic Whites. Among former smokers, across racial/ethnic groups, those who smoked mentholated cigarettes (vs. non-menthols) were significantly less likely to have successfully quit for at least six months: African Americans (ORadj=0.23, 95% CI: 0.17-0.31), Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (ORadj=0.22, 95% CI: 0.11-0.45), Hispanics/Latinos (ORadj=0.48, 95% CI: 0.34-0.69) and Non-Hispanic Whites (ORadj=0.28, 95% CI: 0.25-0.33). CONCLUSION: Across race/ethnic groups, those who used to regularly smoke mentholated cigarettes were less likely to have experienced long-term quitting success. Cessation programs should consider the type of cigarette typically smoked by participants, particularly menthols.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059139?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4214376">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Menthol Cigarettes, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adult, Aged, Demography, epidemiology, Ethnic Groups, ethnology, European Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Menthol, Middle Aged, Population Surveillance, psychology, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, therapy, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Trinidad DR, Pérez-Stable EJ, White MM, Emery SL, Messer K, </td><td> <strong>A nationwide analysis of US racial/ethnic disparities in smoking behaviors, smoking cessation, and cessation-related factors.</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Pérez-Stable EJ, White MM, Emery SL, Messer K, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2011 Apr <br> American journal of public health 101 (4) :699-706 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal187">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal187" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>A nationwide analysis of US racial/ethnic disparities in smoking behaviors, smoking cessation, and cessation-related factors.</strong> <br> Trinidad DR, Pérez-Stable EJ, White MM, Emery SL, Messer K, <br> Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't <br> 2011 Apr <br><p>OBJECTIVES: We used nationally representative data to examine racial/ethnic disparities in smoking behaviors, smoking cessation, and factors associated with cessation among US adults. METHODS: We analyzed data on adults aged 20 to 64 years from the 2003 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, and we examined associations by fitting adjusted logistic regression models to the data. RESULTS: Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, smaller proportions of African Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics/Latinos had ever smoked. Significantly fewer African Americans reported long-term quitting. Racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to be light and intermittent smokers and less likely to smoke within 30 minutes of waking. Adjusted models revealed that racial/ethnic minorities were not less likely to receive advice from health professionals to quit smoking, but they were less likely to use nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Specific needs and ideal program focuses for cessation may vary across racial/ethnic groups, such that approaches tailored by race/ethnicity might be optimal. Traditional conceptualizations of cigarette addiction and the quitting process may need to be revised for racial/ethnic minority smokers.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330593?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3052356">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Health Disparities, Tobacco, Tobacco - Health Disparities, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td></td><td> Adult, Aged, epidemiology, ethnology, Female, Health Behavior, Health Status Disparities, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Viscusi WK, Hersch J, </td><td> <strong>The mortality cost to smokers.</strong> <br> Viscusi WK, Hersch J, <br> Journal Article <br> 2008 Jul <br> Journal of health economics 27 (4) :943-58 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal188">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal188" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>The mortality cost to smokers.</strong> <br> Viscusi WK, Hersch J, <br> Journal Article <br> 2008 Jul <br><p>This article estimates the mortality cost of smoking using the first labor market estimates of the value of statistical life by smoking status.

This study described the proportion of U.S. daily smokers, 18 and older, by stage of change. Selected sociodemographic characteristics were delineated. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected via telephone or face-to-face interview in daily smokers who responded to the Current Population Survey in 1992-1993 (n=39,706), 1995-1996 (n=34,865), or 1998-1999 (n=30,153). Main outcomes included stage of change: (1) Precontemplation-not interested in quitting smoking in next 6 months; (2) Contemplation-interested in quitting smoking in next 6 months but not next 30 days; (3) Preparation-interested in quitting smoking in next 30 days and stopped at least 1 day during past year. RESULTS: During 1992-1993, 59.1% of respondents were precontemplators, 33.2% contemplators, and 7.7% in preparation stage. This distribution was similar in subsequent surveys (1995-1996; 1998-1999). Gender differences were not apparent. Whites were more likely to be precontemplators. As education and income increased, the percentage in precontemplation decreased. Rural residents were more likely in precontemplation and less frequently in preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Among daily smokers, little movement in stage of change was apparent in the United States during the 1990s. Tobacco control efforts must receive high priority to address these static patterns.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12744915?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, epidemiology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Intention, Male, Middle Aged, prevention & control, psychology, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, United States, </td></tr><tr><td> Willis G, Lawrence D, Hartman A, Stapleton Kudela M, Levin K, Forsyth B, </td><td> <strong>Translation of a tobacco survey into Spanish and Asian languages: the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey.</strong> <br> Willis G, Lawrence D, Hartman A, Stapleton Kudela M, Levin K, Forsyth B, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2008 Jun <br> Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 10 (6) :1075-84 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal191">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal191" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Translation of a tobacco survey into Spanish and Asian languages: the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey.</strong> <br> Willis G, Lawrence D, Hartman A, Stapleton Kudela M, Levin K, Forsyth B, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2008 Jun <br><p>Because of the vital need to attain cross-cultural comparability of estimates of tobacco use across subgroups of the U.S. population that differ in primary language use, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Tobacco Use Special Cessation Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUSCS-CPS) was translated into Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Korean, Vietnamese, and Khmer (Cambodian).

The purpose of this study was to examine national trends in (a) parental discordance/concordance in the reporting of home smoking bans and (b) correlates of discordant/concordant reports among two-parent households with underage children from 1995 to 2007. METHODS: Data from the 1995/1996, 1998/1999, 2001/2002, 2003, and 2006/2007 Tobacco Use Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey were used to estimate prevalence rates and multinomial logistic regression models of discordant/concordant parental smoking ban reports by survey period. RESULTS: Overall, the percentage of households in which the 2 parents gave discordant reports on a complete home smoking ban decreased significantly from 12.7% to 2.8% from 1995 to 2007 (p &lt; .001). Compared with households where both parents reported a complete smoking ban, discordant reports were more likely to be obtained from households with current smokers (p &lt; .01) across survey periods. Compared with households where both parents reported the lack of a complete home smoking ban, discordant reports were more likely among households with college graduates, no current smokers, and parents with Hispanic ethnicity (p &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: Parental concordance on the existence of a home smoking ban increased from 1995 to 2007. This suggests estimates of home smoking bans based on just one parent may be more reliable now than they were in the past. Interventions to improve the adoption and enforcement of home smoking bans should target households with current smoker parents.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22377935?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457709">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Research Methodology, Risk Factors, Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, Tobacco - Second-hand Smoke Exposure, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Air Pollution, Indoor, Child, Child, Preschool, epidemiology, Family Characteristics, Family Health, Female, Health Behavior, Health Surveys, Humans, Infant, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Parents, prevention & control, psychology, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, trends, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Zhang X, Martinez-Donate AP, Kuo D, Jones NR, Palmersheim KA, </td><td> <strong>Trends in home smoking bans in the U.S.A., 1995-2007: prevalence, discrepancies and disparities.</strong> <br> Zhang X, Martinez-Donate AP, Kuo D, Jones NR, Palmersheim KA, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. <br> 2012 May <br> Tobacco control 21 (3) :330-6 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal194">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal194" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Trends in home smoking bans in the U.S.A., 1995-2007: prevalence, discrepancies and disparities.</strong> <br> Zhang X, Martinez-Donate AP, Kuo D, Jones NR, Palmersheim KA, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. <br> 2012 May <br><p>BACKGROUND: Home smoking bans significantly reduce the likelihood of secondhand smoke exposure among children and non-smoking adults. The purpose of this study was to examine national trends in (1) the adoption of home smoking bans, (2) discrepancies in parental smoking ban reports and (3) household and parental correlates of home smoking bans among households with underage children from 1995 to 2007. METHODS: The authors used data from the 1995-1996, 1998-1999, 2001-2002, 2003 and 2006-2007 Tobacco Use Supplement of the US Current Population Survey to estimate prevalence rates and logistic regression models of parental smoking ban reports by survey period. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of a complete home smoking bans increased from 58.1% to 83.8% (p&lt;0.01), while discrepancies in parental reports decreased from 12.5% to 4.6% (p&lt;0.01) from 1995 to 2007. Households with single parent, low income, one or two current smokers, parents with less than a college education or without infants were consistently less likely to report a home smoking ban over this period (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite general improvements in the adoption of home smoking bans and a reduction on parental discrepancies, disparities in the level of protection from secondhand smoke have persisted over time. Children living in households with single parents, low income, current smoker parents, less educated parents or without infants are less likely to be protected by a home smoking ban. These groups are in need of interventions promoting the adoption of home smoking bans to reduce disparities in tobacco-related diseases.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21813487?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Tobacco, Tobacco - Home Smoking Restrictions, </td><td></td><td> Adolescent, Adult, Air Pollution, Indoor, Child, Child, Preschool, epidemiology, Family Characteristics, Family Health, Health Behavior, Health Surveys, Humans, Infant, Middle Aged, Parents, prevention & control, psychology, Smoking, Socioeconomic Factors, statistics & numerical data, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, trends, United States, Young Adult, </td></tr><tr><td> Zhu SH, Wang JB, Hartman A, Zhuang Y, Gamst A, Gibson JT, Gilljam H, Galanti MR, </td><td> <strong>Quitting cigarettes completely or switching to smokeless tobacco: do US data replicate the Swedish results?</strong> <br> Zhu SH, Wang JB, Hartman A, Zhuang Y, Gamst A, Gibson JT, Gilljam H, Galanti MR, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2009 Apr <br> Tobacco control 18 (2) :82-7 <br><br> <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal195">View details</a> <br><br> <div id="modal195" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class='modal-header'> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button><div class="modal-caption"> <strong>Quitting cigarettes completely or switching to smokeless tobacco: do US data replicate the Swedish results?</strong> <br> Zhu SH, Wang JB, Hartman A, Zhuang Y, Gamst A, Gibson JT, Gilljam H, Galanti MR, <br> Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural <br> 2009 Apr <br><p>BACKGROUND: Swedish male smokers are more likely than female smokers to switch to smokeless tobacco (snus) and males' smoking cessation rate is higher than that of females. These results have fuelled international debate over promoting smokeless tobacco for harm reduction. This study examines whether similar results emerge in the United States, one of few other western countries where smokeless tobacco has long been widely available. METHODS: US DATA SOURCE: national sample in Tobacco Use Supplement to Current Population Survey, 2002, with 1-year follow-up in 2003. Analyses included adult self-respondents in this longitudinal sample (n=15,056). Population-weighted rates of quitting smoking and switching to smokeless tobacco were computed for the 1-year period. RESULTS: Among US men, few current smokers switched to smokeless tobacco (0.3% in 12 months). Few former smokers turned to smokeless tobacco (1.7%). Switching between cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, infrequent among current tobacco users (&lt;4%), was more often from smokeless to smoking. Men quit smokeless tobacco at three times the rate of quitting cigarettes (38.8% vs 11.6%, p&lt;0.001). Overall, US men have no advantage over women in quitting smoking (11.7% vs 12.4%, p=0.65), even though men are far likelier to use smokeless tobacco. CONCLUSION: The Swedish results are not replicated in the United States. Both male and female US smokers appear to have higher quit rates for smoking than have their Swedish counterparts, despite greater use of smokeless tobacco in Sweden. Promoting smokeless tobacco for harm reduction in countries with ongoing tobacco control programmes may not result in any positive population effect on smoking cessation.</p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168476?dopt=Citation" target="_blank">Look up this article in PubMed</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174060">PubMed Central</a></div></div></div></td><td> Guidance & Policy Research, Monitoring Risk Factors, Prevention, Risk Factors, Surveillance, Tobacco, Tobacco - Smokeless Tobacco, Tobacco - Other Tobacco Products, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Policies, Tobacco - Tobacco Control Programs, Tobacco - Quit Attempts/Smoking Cessation, </td><td> Head and Neck Lung </td><td> Female, Humans, Male, methods, prevention & control, Reproducibility of Results, Sex Factors, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, statistics & numerical data, Sweden, Tobacco, Smokeless, United States, </td></tr></tbody></table>
