      <p><a href="research_assist.html">American Stop  Smoking Intervention Study</a> (ASSIST)<br />
      The  American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Â Prevention (ASSIST) was an 8 year  non-randomized demonstration project for tobacco prevention and control  conducted by the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society and 17  state health departments. The ASSIST monographs (Volumes <a href="monographs/16/index.html" target="_blank">16</a> and <a href="monographs/17/index.html" target="_blank">17</a>) provides the conceptual model,  technical assistance and training information, lessons learned and numerous  practical case studies of a comprehensive national, evidence-based program that  was implemented at the state and community level.</p>
      
      <p>ASSIST  was rolled out in two phases - a two-year planning phase from 1991 to 1993 and  a six-year implementation phase from 1993 to 1999. NCI provided an average of  $1.14 million per state per year during the intervention years, for a total of  $128 million over the eight years of the program. Other additional funding and  support were available to the states through voluntary organizations and other  non-federal sources.<br />

      <p><a href="scrfa.html">Tobacco Research Initiative for State and Community Interventions  (TRISCI)</a><br />
      The  Tobacco Research Initiative for State and Community Interventions stimulated  research on new or existing tobacco control interventions relevant to State and  community tobacco control programs. The initiative supported research on  innovative tobacco prevention and control interventions at the community, State  or multi-state level, particularly policy or media-based interventions. It also  emphasized collaboration between tobacco control researchers, state-based  comprehensive tobacco control programs and community-based coalitions. This  initiative has received two rounds of funding through the &ldquo;Research in State  and Community Tobacco Control Interventions&rdquo; RFAs (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-01-017.html">RFA-CA-01-017</a> and <a href="http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ca-99-001.html">RFA-CA-99-001</a>).  Total investment was $76.4 million for 19 grants over 10 years.<br />

      <p><a href="research_topic-tp-study.html">Tobacco  Products Research and Development Contract</a><br />
      The  National Cancer Institute awarded a five year Research and Development  contract, &ldquo;Laboratory Assessment of Tobacco Use Behavior and Exposure to Toxins  Among Users of New Tobacco Products Promoted to Reduce Harm,&rdquo; in 2006 to  Georgetown University. The purpose of this contract was to develop methods and  measures for product testing and advance scientific knowledge about the toxic  and addictive properties of tobacco products marketed by the tobacco industry  with claims that imply reduced harm. The contract bought together a consortium  of investigators across several institutions. The total award was $3,522,000.<br />

      <p><a href="tturc/">Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Centers (TTURC)</a><br />
      The TTURC initiative was supported by NCI, NIDA,  and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Within eight academic institutions,  these Centers conduct a broad array of studies, including projects evaluating  new models of nicotine addiction, the role of genetic and environmental factors  in smoking initiation and persistence, methods for preventing tobacco use  across cultures, and determinants of relapse. This initiative has received two  rounds of funding (1999-2004 and 2004-2009) through the TTURC RFAs (<a href="http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-98-029.html">CA-98-029</a> and<strong> </strong><a href="http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-04-012.html">CA-04-012</a>).  Total investment was $145.5 million to eight institutions over 10 years.<br />

      <p><a href="youth.html">Youth Tobacco Prevention and Cessation</a><br />
      In partnership with other NIH  Institutes, TCRB funded innovative research exploring tobacco use by children and youth in the  United States.</p>
      
      <p><strong><a name="researchnetwork" id="researchnetwork"></a>Research Networks</strong><br />
      <a href="http://www.tobaccoresearch.net/">Global Tobacco Research Network</a><a href="../../exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="../../images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a><br />
      In  2002, NCI began funding the Global Tobacco Research Network (GTRN) as a  complement to the Fogarty International Center International Tobacco and Health  Research and Capacity Building Program. GTRN is an information network of  tobacco control researchers providing links to a database of tobacco-related  research to facilitate communication and collaboration among scientists.</p>
      
      <p><a href="http://www.tobacco-cessation.org/">National Tobacco Cessation  Collaborative (NTCC)</a><a href="../../exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="../../images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer" /></a><br />
      The National Tobacco Cessation Collaborative (NTCC) was formed in June 2005 to improve the public's health by increasing successful cessation among tobacco users in the U.S. and Canada through collaborative efforts of committed organizations. Collaborative members represent major organizations that fund research, program, and policy initiatives related to tobacco cessation, as well as other organizations with a vested interest in tobacco cessation. As of September 30, 2011, NTCC is no longer operational.</p>
      
      <p>Systems  and Network Development Initiatives<br />
      Several  projects have been funded to support the understanding of tobacco control  systems (e.g., improving the progression of discovery to development, and to  delivery) and the development of collaborative networks of scientists in order  to improve communication and collaboration on tobacco control research in  priority areas. Collaborations ensure that funds are used as efficiently and  effectively as possible. In addition, networks create the opportunity for  increasing transdisciplinarity across existing research grants and initiatives.  Networks on tobacco products purported to reduce harm and disparities have been  created and are progressing, and networks on surveillance/evaluation and  cessation are planned.</p>
      
      <p><strong><a href="trend/index.html">Tobacco Research  Network on Disparities (TReND)</a></strong><br />
      The  NCI partnered with the American Legacy Foundation to develop and implement the  Tobacco Research Network on Disparities (TReND). The mission of the Network was  to understand and address tobacco-related health disparities by advancing the  science, translating that scientific knowledge into practice, and informing  public policy. TReND was designed to stimulate new studies, challenge existing  paradigms, and address significant gaps in research on understudied and  underserved populations. TReND included a diverse disciplines of researchers  who seek to achieve the following goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>encourage  collaborations among multiple research disciplines;</li>
        <li>serve  as a forum for generating new ideas and research projects focusing on  tobacco-related health disparities;</li>
        <li>establish  a translation mechanism for communicating and interacting with other networks  and community advocacy groups;</li>
        <li>promote  the involvement and training of junior investigators and the participation of  senior researchers in health disparities research; and</li>
        <li>provide  scientific information and serve as a resource on tobacco and health  disparities issues.</li>
      </ul>

      The  Youth Tobacco Cessation Collaborative (YTCC) was formed in 1998 to address the  gap in knowledge about what cessation strategies are most effective in  assisting youth to quit smoking. Collaborative members represent major  organizations that fund research, program, and policy initiatives related to  controlling youth tobacco use. As of September 30, 2011, YTCC is no longer operational.</p>
