    <h1>Science of Research and Technology Branch Strategic Plan 2014</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Approximately half of  all deaths are attributable to a circumscribed number of preventable behaviors  such as tobacco use, poor diet, and physical inactivity. These behavioral risk  factors also contribute substantially to disability, reduced quality of life,  and increased healthcare costs. Behavior&rsquo;s contribution to disease and death is  particularly salient for cancer. About a third of cancer deaths are the result  of tobacco use alone, and another third are attributable to poor diet, physical  inactivity, and obesity. Additional behavioral risk factors such as sun  exposure and nonadherence to recommended cancer screenings further increase the  risk of cancer morbidity and mortality.</p>
      <p>There have been  considerable advances in changing these cancer risk behaviors. A combination of  new treatments for nicotine dependence and recent tobacco control policy  initiatives has cut smoking rates in half over the past half century. A variety  of diet and physical activity interventions have been shown to reduce weight,  improve diet, and increase regular physical activity. Successful public health  campaigns have reduced sun exposure and increased cancer screenings. These interventions,  however, often produce relatively modest and short-term changes in health  behaviors, often at considerable cost, and frequently fail to scale up or  disseminate broadly.</p>
      <p>To further advance our  understanding of health behaviors and their mechanisms of change, our approach  to behavioral research must change. Theories of behavior must become more  integrated, multi-level, explanatory, and rigorously testable. Measures of  behavior and its putative mechanisms must become more precise and  longitudinally intensive. Emerging methods, analytics, and technologies must be  leveraged Â to improve behavioral  research. Cross-disciplinary research teams must be utilized and optimized to  integrate expertise from a wide array of fields with the pressing questions in  health behavior research.</p>
      <p>The National Cancer  Institute&rsquo;s Behavioral Research Program (BRP) within the Division of Cancer  Control and Population Sciences initiates, supports, and evaluates a  comprehensive program of research ranging from basic behavioral research to the  development, testing, and dissemination of interventions in areas such as  tobacco use, screening, dietary behavior, and sun protection with the goal to  increase the breadth, depth, and quality of behavioral research in cancer  prevention and control. Recognizing the need to make further advancements in  the conduct of behavioral science, the BRP created the Science of Research and  Technology Branch (SRTB) in 2012 to <em>lead  and support the development and application of innovative research approaches,  theories, methods, measures, analytic tools, and technologies to advance social  and behavioral science in the context of cancer prevention and control.</em></p>
      <p>Since its inception, the  SRTB has engaged in an iterative strategic planning process involving internal  input as well as external input from an SRTB expert panel. The result of this  effort has been an internal working document to guide the direction and  initiatives of the branch, from which this publicly accessible SRTB Strategic  Plan is based. In anticipation of the rapidly changing behavioral research  landscape, this plan is not a static document, but instead reflects a dynamic  iterative process that will produce frequent updates.</p>
      <p><strong>SRTB  Scientific Priorities</strong></p>
      <p>The scientific priorities  of the SRTB include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Theory development, testing, integration, and  application;</li>
        <li>Measure development and testing, particularly  of antecedents to, changes in, and consequences of health behavior;</li>
        <li>Methodological innovation, particularly in  analytic approaches;</li>
        <li>Data harmonization and research synthesis; </li>
        <li>Technology development and application in  behavioral research; and</li>
        <li>Team science and cross-disciplinary  approaches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although each scientific  priority is treated separately in this strategic plan, there is considerable  overlap and synergy among these priorities as they contribute to the common  mission to facilitate innovative research in cancer prevention and control. Therefore,  actions that address multiple scientific priorities of the branch are  particularly important for the SRTB to pursue.</p>
      <p><strong>Effectively  addressing these priorities requires critical examination of our current health  behavior science methods, measures, theories, and scientific approaches, and  encouraging new approaches that are potentially disruptive to the current  behavioral science enterprise.</strong> The genomic and wireless digital technology forces that contribute to Topol&rsquo;s  &ldquo;creative destruction of medicine&rdquo; also contribute to the creative destruction  of behavior research. These forces will necessitate the questioning of accepted  practice in the behavioral sciences and produce disruptive, paradigmatic  changes in how behavioral research is conducted. As the branch within BRP  charged with improving how behavioral science is conducted, the SRTB is well-positioned  to facilitate these changes in health behavior research and encourage novel  approaches that challenge the status quo.</p>
      <p><strong>Effectively  addressing these priorities also requires breaking down disciplinary boundaries  and seeking new approaches to advance health behavior research from  engineering, computer science, basic behavioral science, social sciences,  genetics, systems biology, neurology, and a range of other disciplines.</strong> One disruption of the status quo  already taking place is the shift from independent researchers to cross-disciplinary  teams of researchers formed to tackle increasingly complex research questions.  Therefore, one priority within the SRTB is supporting and improving team  science to facilitate the disruption of the status quo and the adoption of new  approaches.      </p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
      <p id="pa1"><strong>Priority  Area 1. Improve the scientific rigor with which health behavior theories are  tested and applied.</strong></p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 1: Promote integration among health behavior theories and encourage common  ontologies and measures of these theoretical constructs.</em> The ability to advance health  behavior theory is limited by the current cacophony of disparate theories with  similar constructs. Promote more empirical evidence to test the overlap and relative  explanatory power of nominally different existing constructs and to assess the  added explanatory value of additional constructs in existing theories,  especially multi-level theories and theories from outside the cancer prevention  and control field. The NCI Grid-Enabled Measures (GEM) database, especially the  theory workspace in GEM, provides a platform in which different theoretical  constructs and their measures can be compared and contrasted to facilitate  theory integration. GEM can be augmented by other web services that will allow  the field to better map theories, constructs, and measures and their  relationships to the behavior of interest and to the intervention components  that influence these theoretical constructs. Apply newer approaches and  technologies such as crowdsourcing, word-mining, semantic analysis, Delphi  approaches, and modern measurement theory to evaluate the overlap/uniqueness of  existing health behavior theories.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 2: Encourage and support the use of new data sources and methods for  theory testing.</em> Theory  testing must become more rigorous so that health behavior theories can be  supported or refuted, and retained, modified, or replaced to increase  explanatory power. Information about behavior and its influences is increasingly  available from ubiquitous technologies such as mobile phones and social media.  Whether from prospective or archival data collection methods, data are  increasingly more temporally dense and &ldquo;big&rdquo; (high volume, variety, and  velocity), requiring advanced analytic approaches. To advance more rigorous  theory testing, especially via these new data sources and methods, cancer  prevention and control researchers need greater access to these data sources  and to advanced statistical and computational collaborators, as well as  training in these approaches. Collaboratively with NCI&rsquo;s Cancer Intervention  and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET), the SRTB will encourage the use of  computational modeling for computer-assisted theory development and testing.  Coordinating these efforts with NIH&rsquo;s Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative,  along with complementary efforts specifically targeted to cancer prevention and  control researchers, should facilitate the use of these data sources and  analytics for theory testing.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 3: Encourage and train cancer prevention and control researchers in the  rigorous application of theory to health behavior intervention development and  evaluation.</em> Building  from the successful NCI Advanced Training Institute on Health Behavior Theory,  develop complementary online and in-person training to expand the breadth and  reach of this resource. Provide training and guidance in theory-based  intervention development and theory-testing within cancer prevention and  control intervention studies, including component analyses, mediation analyses,  and the construction of comparison conditions that are theoretically distinct.  Promote the use in intervention research of explicit, a priori, testable  conceptual models based on empirically supported health behavior theories.      </p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
      <p id="pa2"><strong>Priority  Area 2. Encourage the development and use of precise, accurate, efficient,  technologically advanced, and harmonized measures of cancer prevention and  control behaviors and their influences.</strong></p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 4: Improve and harmonize self-report measures of cancer prevention and  control-relevant constructs and behaviors</em>. Applying rigorous qualitative methods, modern  psychometric theory (e.g., Item Response Theory), and technologically advanced administration  (e.g., computer adaptive testing, ecological momentary assessment) to both  existing and new measures of cancer prevention and control constructs should result  in more precise, accurate, and efficiently administered measures that can be  harmonized for data sharing and integration. Continued support for the NCI GEM database  provides a platform for comparing measures of a given construct and assisting  researchers in selecting appropriate study measures and creating harmonized  data.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 5: Encourage the development and integration of passive sensor  technologies in cancer prevention and control research. </em>There has been exponential growth in  passive sensor technologies that monitor behavior and its influences with  minimal respondent burden. Expand these technologies and make them more  applicable for cancer prevention and control research. Encourage field testing,  including assessment of the relationship between these sensors and traditional  measures, pairing the engineers developing these sensors with clinical  researchers&rsquo; content expertise and patient access. Promote sensor data  harmonization and integration efforts. Encourage cancer prevention and control  researchers to test and adopt these new technologies. Many sensors have been  developed for commercial, non-research Â purposes, and gaining Â access to the data from these commercial  sensors should be pursued.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 6: Support the development of measures assessing higher-level constructs  in multi-level systems. </em>Compared  to individual-level constructs, the measurement of higher-level constructs that  influence behavior (e.g., family interaction, social supports, community,  workplace or healthcare settings, policy) have received relatively little  attention. Develop and test precise, accurate, efficient, technologically advanced,  and harmonized measures of these higher-level constructs.      </p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
      <p id="pa3"><strong>Priority  Area 3. Support the development and application of new analytic approaches that  align with emerging data sources in cancer prevention and control. </strong></p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 7: Improve the capabilities of electronic health records (EHRs) as a  research data source for cancer control and prevention. </em>While EHRs provide considerable,  albeit noisy, data on various biomedical indices of health and illness,  behavioral risk factors, and especially influences on these behavioral risk  factors, are largely ignored in the standard EHR. Working with federal and  non-federal agencies involved in EHR standards (e.g., Office of the National  Coordinator), encourage adequate measurement of key behavioral indicators and  influences of behavior. Encourage the harmonization and standardization of  these measures in EHRs, as well as the systems and technologies to extract  these data for research purposes.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 8: Facilitate the use of &ldquo;big data,&rdquo; especially non-traditional big data  sets (e.g., from social media, search engines, mobile phones) for cancer  prevention and control research.</em> Extending the application of big data to theory advancement outlined in Action Plan  2 (to encourage and support the use of new data sources and methods for theory  testing), big data provide cancer prevention and control researchers with  novel, broad, and non-traditional methods to answer a wide range of behavioral  research questions. Develop and refine procedures for identifying, accessing,  and managing these big data sets, with appropriate security and privacy  protections. Support the refinement of big data analytic approaches (e.g., data  mining, pattern recognition) for cancer prevention and control research. Provide  training in these big data management and analytic approaches to cancer  prevention and control researchers.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 9: Expand the translation and adoption of intensive longitudinal data  analyses and within-subject designs in cancer prevention and control research.</em> The rapid expansion of technologies that  provide temporally dense, intensive longitudinal data (e.g., ecological  momentary assessments on mobile phones, passive sensors) are anticipated to  transform behavioral sciences from predominantly between-subject,  cross-sectional designs to within-subject longitudinal designs. Refine emerging  analytic approaches that make maximum use of within-subject variability and  patterns and make them available to cancer prevention and control researchers  via education and training. Single-case designs also benefit from the  increasing availability of intensive longitudinal data and the acceptance,  refinement, and dissemination of various single-case designs and analyses should  be promoted.Â  </p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 10: Increase the capacity of cancer prevention and control researchers to use  innovative designs and statistical approaches. </em>While the traditional two-arm randomized  controlled trial is a valuable design for answering certain behavioral  questions, it is overused and sometimes inappropriately used for questions that  are better answered via other designs. Encourage training in alternative  designs, including but not limited to system science approaches, intervention  optimization designs, and within-subject designs. Targets for such training  include behavioral researchers as well as grant reviewers and journal editors,  who can facilitate the adoption of these alternative approaches. Consider these  alternative designs not only as a means to answer cancer prevention and control  questions more rigorously, but also more efficiently, using less time and  resources.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 11: Facilitate the development and adoption of data-harmonization  practices.</em> For  emerging data sources to be of maximal use, researchers should be able to share  and merge their data with other databases. Coordinating with related efforts,  such as those of the NIH Biomedical Informatics Council, facilitate the  development, refinement, and dissemination of the infrastructure needed for  data sharing and merging, especially among cancer prevention and control  researchers. Encourage the use of common data elements and common measurement  metrics. Pursue support for common data repositories, cloud computing models,  and other resources used to facilitate data sharing. Improve the cost-benefit  ratio associated with data sharing (e.g., by eliminating barriers to data  sharing, incentivizing sharing). Refine integrative data analysis approaches and  further disseminate them among the cancer prevention and control community.      </p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
      <p id="pa4"><strong>Priority  Area 4. Encourage technology development, evaluation, and application for  cancer prevention and control research. </strong></p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 12: Foster the development of new technologies and the refinement and  adoption of existing technologies with the potential to advance behavioral research. </em>Technology can be  used to assess behavior and its influences, and to deliver and evaluate  just-in-time adaptive interventions. The behavioral sciences have begun and  should continue to adopt these technologies to improve behavioral assessments  and interventions. In addition to leveraging existing technologies for  behavioral research, support is also needed for novel technological development  to fulfill specific behavioral research needs not met by existing technologies.  While technologies are increasingly being developed for consumer and clinical  uses, more substantial use is needed in cancer prevention and control research,  including to improve recruitment, retention, and to further automate clinical  trials. Foster collaborations between cancer prevention and control researchers  and engineers/computer scientists to realize the potential of these new  technologies. Additional collaborations between NIH and the National Science  Foundation (NSF), especially in relation to NSF&rsquo;s Smart and Connected Health Program,  and between academic and private entities, will facilitate the use of these  technologies for behavioral research.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 13: Improve the research infrastructure for testing and evaluating  tech-based behavioral interventions. </em>The  evaluation of tech-based behavioral interventions could be facilitated with  better research infrastructure. Test beds, rapid testing platforms, and  registries of end users of specific technologies allow for rapid and iterative  preliminary testing of new tech-based interventions. Open and modular software  development allows the field to share development efforts and to more easily  add or remove specific intervention components, especially for intervention  optimization research. Guidance is needed to assess tech-based interventions in  ways that reduce the need to re-evaluate similar interventions delivered on  different platforms. Encourage more rapid testing methods to complete  evaluations of new tech-based interventions before the technology becomes dated.      </p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
      <p id="pa5"><strong>Priority  Area 5. Advance our understanding of effective team science and  cross-disciplinary approaches.Â  </strong></p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 14: Facilitate effective team science collaborations, as well as training  in team science, through the development of practical tools and resources and  funding opportunities. </em>Develop  and disseminate evidence-based approaches for managing, conducting, funding, and  evaluating effective and efficient cross-disciplinary, team-based research to  speed innovation and breakthroughs in cancer prevention and control. Increase evidence-informed  support for team-based research approaches at both academic institutions and funding  agencies. Encourage training opportunities for team-based approaches in cancer  prevention and control research.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 15: Support the development and evolution of the &ldquo;science of team science&rdquo;  field by supporting platforms for knowledge sharing and information exchange. </em>A range of dissemination efforts are  needed to accelerate the development and dissemination of principles, tools,  methods, and resources in support of effective, team-based approaches to cancer  prevention and control research, including conferences, special journal issues  devoted to team science, and web-based technologies for knowledge sharing and  information exchange on team science. These tools and resources should be  applicable for training, education, and professional development in team-based  research approaches for investigators at multiple career stages.</p>
      <p><em>Action  Plan 16: Use innovative multi-method approaches to study the processes and  outcomes of cross-disciplinary team science initiatives.</em> Apply novel methods, metrics,  definitions, models, and approaches to the evaluation of cross-disciplinary  team science initiatives. Develop the evidence base for team-based research,  including effective practices and the potential added value this research could  bring toward achieving key goals in cancer prevention and control.    </p>
