      <p>The overall theme of the UTMB Center for Population Health and Health   Disparities is to understand the mechanisms responsible for lower   cancer incidence, lower prevalence of other diseases, and lower   mortality associated with the increasing percent of Hispanics in the   neighborhood.  Projects are stimulated by our recent preliminary   findings that more homogeneous Hispanic neighborhoods (higher percent   Hispanic) have a protective impact on cancer incidence and mortality.    The center aims thus to extend the literature on the &quot;Hispanic   Paradox&quot;---relatively good health despite relatively poor socioeconomic   conditions---to the community context.  Project 1 further explores the   influence of the community context on cancer incidence and mortality   using several available data sets.  In addition, the National Health and   Nutrition Examination Survey is employed to examine the association of   the community context (tract percent Hispanic, percent poverty) and   social support with health behaviors relevant to cancer, affective   disorders, and physiologic measures.  Project 2 proposes a community   survey of Mexican Americans living near a large petrochemical complex.    The aim is to examine associations among neighborhood context, perceived   risk from the hazard, coping, stress, and health outcomes over time.    Project 3 will conduct community-based participatory research to test   interventions to reduce cancer risks in Mexican Americans and use   knowledge obtained from Projects 1 and 2 to expand those interventions.    The Center will have two cores.  The Administrative Core will provide   overall direction and administrative support and coordination of all   components.  The Survey, Data Management and Statistical Analysis Core   will conduct surveys for Projects 2 and 3 and provide analytical support   to all investigators.  The team of investigators includes medical   doctors, epidemiologists, sociologists, demographers, geographers,   statisticians and basic biological scientists.</p>

      <p>This Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) will   address significant gaps in our knowledge about factors that predict   prostate cancer outcomes, and in particular the causes of disparity in   prostate cancer outcomes between men of African and Caucasian descent.   The mission of the proposed center is to 1) study the complex   interaction of biological, clinical, behavioral, and environmental   factors predictive of outcomes following a prostate cancer diagnosis, 2)   evaluate how these factors explain disparities in prostate cancer   outcomes by ethnicity, and 3) disseminate this information to at-risk   populations and the public health community.  The CPHHD builds on our   existing multidisciplinary research resources that include studies of   the genetics, quality of life, patterns of care, physical environment,   and social environment after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This   research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across molecular   biology, genetic epidemiology, sociology, the behavioral sciences, and   health policy.  The proposed research has implications for clinical and   public health practice, with potential to catalyze critical improvements   in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.  Specific Aim 1:    To undertake four highly interrelated research projects aimed at   identifying factors that influence prostate cancer outcomes. These   projects will evaluate the role of behavioral and environmental factors   associated with physician and patient screening practices, screening   behavior and genotypes on prostate cancer clinical outcomes, social and   environmental factors on quality of life, and discrimination on   treatment and medical outcomes after prostate cancer diagnoses.    Specific Aim 2: To create three specialized cores to serve the needs of   the CPHHD. These include: (1) an Administration Core to oversee and   evaluate the CPHHD; (2) a Community Education and Dissemination Core to   facilitate ongoing interactions with our community partners, and to   translate the information gained from this research to the public health   community and general population; and (3) a Biomedical Informatics Core   to provide integrated data management and to construct a comprehensive   model of the multivariate biological, behavioral, social, and   environmental factors on prostate cancer outcomes.  Specific Aim 3: To   solicit and support a series of focused high priority developmental   (pilot) research projects. These projects will be chosen to extend the   primary research projects to additional studies of cancer screening,   biological interactions, statistical model building for the integration   of complex data from various disciplines.  These developmental projects   will expand the scope of the research proposed and enhance the   multidisciplinary research team with members representing additional   disciplines and expertise.</p>

      <p>This Center has four aims: 1) to use the elements of the Berkman and   Glass model to address the disparity that we have defined as the   center's theme, &quot;The Apparent Disconnect between Rates of Screening and   the Stage of Diagnosis of Breast Cancer by Race and Ethnicity.&quot;  The   &quot;disconnect&quot; arises because African American women and Hispanic women   increasingly report receiving mammography at rates equivalent to those   reported by Caucasian women.  Yet, African American and Hispanic women   continue to experience higher breast cancer mortality rates compared to   Caucasian women; 2) to develop this model and the variables to the point   where it can be tested with breast cancer and then eventually, be   extended to other cancers where similar disparities exist; 3) to develop   the capacity to conduct multidisciplinary research that addresses the   biological, behavioral, social and environmental factors that affect   prognosis and outcome of cancer; 4) to demonstrate through a sustainable   partnership with one or more community-based organizations the use of   theory-driven interventions which, if shown to be successful, can be   integrated into the way in which cancer is detected and managed in the   community.  Four projects and four cores comprise this Center.  The   Cores are: Core A: Administration, Core B: Ascertainment of patients;   Core C: Survey Research Core, and Core D: Statistics. These cores   support four projects. <strong>Project 1:  Neighborhood and Individual Effect on Stage at Diagnosis</strong> (Richard B. Wamecke, PI).  This project is being carried out with a community-based partner. <strong>Project 2:  Social Network Effects on Breast Cancer Prognosis</strong> (Yoosik Youm, PI). <strong>Project 3: Breast Cancer Delay in Black, Hispanic and White Women</strong> (Carol Estwing Ferrans, PI). <strong>Project 4: Mediators and Ethnic Disparity in Breast Cancer Prognosis</strong> (Garth Rauscher, PI).  All studies have interdisciplinary teams and the   questions asked by each study are interrelated and focus on the four   levels of impact on breast cancer disparity from community, to the   interpersonal network to the individual and finally to the issues of   access to care.  All are multilevel and include social, behavioral and   community level issues.</p>

      <p><strong>The Ohio State University &amp; University of Michigan - NCI</strong><br />
        Center Director/Principal Investigator: Electra Paskett, Ph.D.</p>
      <p>In response to RFA ES-02-009, a multi-disciplinary group of   investigators from the Ohio State University and the University of   Michigan have collaborated to propose a Center for Population Health and   Health Disparities focusing on an important health issue in underserved   populations, cancer.  The Center will initially focus on the goal of   understanding <u>why</u> high rates of cervical cancer incidence and   mortality are observed in Appalachian Ohio, a mainly rural area in   Southern and Eastern Ohio.  This goal will be accomplished using   community-based participatory research with the framework of the Social   Determinants of Health model in three inter-related projects and four   supporting cores.  All studies will be conducted in 16 clinics which   represent the general population of women aged 18 and older in the   region.  We will utilize the Center's internal and external advisory   committees and community partners organized into a community advisory   board and consortium of community organizations to facilitate the   accomplishment of project goals. Project 1 will recruit 1600 women to an   observational study to investigate multi-level (social, environmental,   behavioral, and biological) correlates of &quot;risk-appropriate&quot; Pap smear   utilization, in Phase I.  From this cohort of women, those who smoke   (30%) will be eligible to participate in Project 2, which tests the   effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote   smoking cessation (behavioral) and validate cessation endpoints with   saliva cotinine measurements (biological) in a quasi-experimental trial   design; those women who are in need of a PaP test (48% of 1600) will be   eligible to participate in Phase II of Project 1 which will test the   effectiveness of a lay health educator (social) intervention to promote   &quot;risk-appropriate&quot; Pap smear utilization (behavioral) and follow-up for   abnormalities (biological) detected in quasi-experimental trail design.    Project 3 will examine the contribution of HPV (biological) to cervical   abnormalities in Appalachia in relation to individual-level behaviors   (e.g. smoking, sexual activity) within the social and environmental   region of Appalachia in a case-control observational study among women   who have Pap smears in these 16 clinics.  The research will be supported   by four cores: A) Administration - fiscal and Center oversight; B)   Biostatistics and Data Resources - sample selection, data management,   data analysis, and population data resources; C) Clinical Correlative   Sciences - collect, obtain and process biomarker specimens; and D)   Behavioral Assessment and Intervention - train interviewers and lay   health educators, conduct interviews, design intervention material, and   facilitate communication among sites.  The Center includes a mechanism   for pilot project solicitation, review and funding.  This Center has   institutional commitment in terms of personnel, funds and space, as well   as, a commitment to focus on the problem of health disparities in the   region. Finally, members of the team have worked together in the past in   various settings that focus on the goals of the proposed Center and   have an established relationship in Appalachian Ohio for the purpose of   improving the health of the population.  Future work of this Center will   focus on moving this type of multi-level observational and   interventional community-based research into other areas where health   disparities exit in relation to cancer within our region.</p>

        Center Director/Principal Investigator: <a href="http://imb.uchicago.edu/people/members/gehlert.shtml">Sarah Gehlert, Ph.D.</a></p>
      <p>The specific aims of the Center for Interdisciplinary Health Disparities Research area to: <strong>Aim 1</strong>:   bring together scientists from inside and outside the University and   members of the community who are especially vulnerable to adverse health   conditions to inform the Center's scientific agenda; <strong>Aim 2</strong>:   foster investigations that consider health disparities from multiple   levels of analysis via shared conceptual frameworks that integrate   discipline-specific theories and methods; <strong>Aim 3</strong>: increase interest in health disparities among scientists and students from various disciplines and from community members; <strong>Aim 4</strong>:   develop measures and methods that are appropriate for use with   vulnerable populations and that allow factors at various levels   (social/environmental, behavioral/psychological, and biological/genetic)   to be analyzed together; <strong>Aim 5</strong>: increase existing   knowledge on the social, behavioral, and biological factors that   influence health disparities and the nature of their interactions; and <strong>Aim 6</strong>:   disseminate findings through channels established through the Center to   as wide an audience as possible, including members of vulnerable   populations, community-based organizations and agencies, and scientific   investigators inside and outside the University. In its first five   years, the Center will focus on group differences in breast cancer,   notably why Black women in the U.S. and West Africa experience breast   cancers that occur at a younger age and are more aggressive and lethal   than those of White women.  McClintock (R01 #1) will compare, based on   an animal model of social regulation of mammary tumor biology developed   in her laboratory, the gene regulation in mammary tumors and the ovarian   function of socially isolated and group-living rats.  Olopade (R01 #2)   will (a) look at the molecular characterization of primary patient   samples in Nigeria and Chicago's South Side to see if alterations in   BRCA1 contribute to breast cancer in younger Black women and (b) explore   the McClintock model in primary patient samples.  Gehlert and Masi (R01   #3; CBPR) will explore emic views of breast cancer and its treatment   and test the McClintock model with community volunteers.  In the latter,   they will examine neighborhood and community factors (such as   collective efficacy and crime), living situations and social   connectedness, behavioral responses (such as vigilance and perceived   stress), and biological (e.g., cortisol levels) and health outcomes   (most notably breast cancer).  Conzen (R01 #4) will study rate of   mammary tumor growth, response to chemotherapy, and chemoprevention in   two animal models.  The Tissue Core will provide analysis of mammary   tissue.  Coordination and dissemination will occur through the   Administrative Core, by means of Faculty Colloquium and Monthly Speaker   Series, In-Service and Summer Apprenticeship programs, a Center Web site   and Web page for communication with other CPHHDs, etc. </p>

      <p>The Wayne State University (WSU) Center for African Urban Health is a   5-year proposal that consists of five Cores and four Projects with   participation of 34 investigators from various Departments, Centers, and   Programs across the WSU campus.  The Center has invested heavily in   coalescing and expanding a shared research infrastructure that is widely   accessible to investigators.  The five Cores represent specialized   areas of expertise and services required to undertake testing of   multi-level hypotheses related to research in racial health disparities.    These Cores form the foundation of our application.  The Cores are: 1)   Administration; 2) Psychosocial and Community Measures; 3) Recruitment   and Clinical Assessment; 4) Biostatistics and Research Database; and 5)   Genomics Core.  These Cores allow the investigators to test a broader   range of Project-specific study hypotheses in a more cost-efficient   manner than would be possible with stand-alone Projects.  African   Americans were selected as the exclusive study population for the Center   because of their high burden of obesity-related disease such as breast   cancer and cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, heart failure,   diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease).  Also, while Detroit has   the third largest population of African Americans, it has the highest   percentage (81.6%) of African Americans of any major city in the U.S.    The four Projects are: Project 1: Obesity, Nitric Oxide, Oxidative   Stress and Salt Sensitivity; Project 2: Weight Loss in Breast Cancer   Survivors; Project 3: A Dyadic Intervention for Cardiac Rehabilitation   Patients; and Project 4: Promotion of Healthy Behavior in African   American Women.  These Projects are thematically linked through obesity,   diet and other lifestyle factors including physical activity and   obesity-related cardiovascular disease and cancer.  Our research efforts   are focused on understanding the mechanisms operating at multiple   levels (environment, lifestyle, physiology, genetics) mediating known   disparate chronic conditions and their precursors.  We also seek to   identify preventive strategies and therapeutic approaches that might   alleviate the disproportionate burden of disease.  Primary as well as   interactive effects of environmental exposures (household and   community-level) and psychobehavioral characteristics with physiological   measures (e.g., 24-hour BP burden and oxidative stress), genes, and   body composition will be explored in relation to their impact on study   outcomes.</p>

      <p>Neighborhoods impact a host of health outcomes, including infant   mortality, the development of asthma and heart disease, and life   expectancy, independent of personal characteristics.  The pathways   through which neighborhoods &quot;get under the skin&quot; are only partly   understood.  This Center will study neighborhood influences on health,   focusing on those characteristics of neighborhoods that are potentially   amenable to change through changes in public policy.  The Center has the   following goals: 1) To conduct research to explain how neighborhoods   contribute to health throughout the life cycle, including through   biological pathways and health behaviors. 2) To develop a rich data   resource that can be used to advance the understanding of how   neighborhoods influence health, and the biological pathways through   which such influences work. 3) To develop robust community-based   participatory research (CBPR) partnerships within each of the 3 cities   in which RAND is located, involving both community-based organizations   and academic institutions. 4) To develop and foster a community of   interdisciplinary researchers (including social and basic scientists)   focused on the social determinants of health, specifically the role of   neighborhoods in health. 5) To contribute to improving public policies   that can improve population health through a set of policy   recommendations that are developed from the results of the Center's   research. The Center, which places a high priority on community-based   participatory research, will be composed of 4 projects, 2 pilots, and 2   cores.  Projects span 3 levels of analysis: biological,   social/environmental, and behavioral/psychological. <strong>Project 1</strong> will examine the impact of a large natural experiment involving the   development and renovation of recreational facilities on physical   activity and other health outcomes. <strong>Project 2</strong> will study neighborhood factors that impact the functional and cognitive aspects of the disabling process in the elderly. <strong>Project 3</strong> examines the relationships between neighborhoods and biological markers of allostatic load. <strong>Project 4</strong> studies the impact of the built environment on mental health. <strong>Pilot 1</strong> examines the interactions in prostate cancer.  An <strong>administrative core</strong> will support the entire project.  A <strong>data and methods core</strong> provides data and computing support, and serves as a focus for intellectual activity around measurement and statistical issues.</p>

      <p>Puerto Rican older adults living in the U.S. mainland have been   identified as a group highly at risk of excess chronic conditions,   particularly diabetes, depression, and physical impairment. Few studies   have been conducted on this rapidly growing and generally low-income   ethnic group. To reduce health disparities, it is necessary to   understand the factors that combine to progress to poor health outcomes.   The overall aim of this Center is to perform a series of inter-related   studies involving a cohort of older adults of Puerto Rican origin to   evaluate specific stressors affecting the Puerto Rican community, and to   determine the effect of these stressors on allostatic load and, in   turn, on disease-specific outcomes. The Center will include four   research projects. Project 1 is a prospective 2-year cohort study that   will investigate both baseline and 2-year prospective associations   between psychosocial stressors and allostatic load; and in turn,   allostatic load and functional decline, specifically depression,   cognitive decline and physical disability; along with the role of   support, and vitamin intake and status in modifying these associations.   Project 2 is a sociological investigation of psychosocial stressors and   their measurement using both qualitative and quantitative methodology to   gain contextual understanding of the sources of stress in this   population that relate to allostatic load, and adapt instruments for its   measurement. Project 3 consists of intervention studies. Using subsets   of the baseline study, researchers will investigate the effectiveness of   three different 2-year interventions in reducing indicators of   allostatic load. Each is designed to be feasible for expansion by   community agencies if effective. These include: 1) vitamin   supplementation; 2) food coupons and nutrition education; and 3) social   support and participation. Project 4 will investigate genetic   contributions of allostatic load. Investigators will explore the   relationship between selected gene variants and allostatic load at   baseline and with change over time, and will investigate the interaction   between gene variants and responses to the differing nutrition and   social interventions. Three cores will work with all projects, including   administrative, statistical, and laboratory cores. A pilot grants   program during years 2 through 4 will encourage additional   investigations relevant to the Center theme.</p>
