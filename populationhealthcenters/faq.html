        <h2>Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities</h2>
        <p><strong>Application Information: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
        <p><strong>1.	Is international research permitted? </strong> Yes,   international research is permitted.  Note that only domestic (U.S.)   institutions are eligible to apply for this program, but collaboration   with foreign organizations is permitted.  So, the overall Principal   Investigator of the P50 application must be affiliated with a U.S.   institution, but you may have collaborating investigators from foreign   institutions. </p>
        <p><strong>2.	Can a junior investigator be the Principal Investigator of the entire P50?</strong> While this is permitted, it is strongly discouraged because PIs with   significant research and management experience, particularly with large   and complicated grants funded by the NIH, may be given priority in peer   review.  Generally only senior investigators have such extensive   experience. </p>
        <p><strong>3.	Can a junior investigator lead a Core or subproject?</strong> Yes, junior investigators may lead any of the P50 components:  research   projects, community-based participatory research, shared facility core   resources, administrative core and pilot projects.  However, credentials   and experience of junior investigators will be part of the review   criteria used to evaluate any and all component parts of the P50   application. </p>
        <p><strong>4.	Is the overall Principal Investigator required to lead one of the above P50 components?</strong> No. </p>
        <p><strong>5.	Which of the above P50 components is required?</strong> An Administrative Core and three (3) meritorious research projects are   required.  At least one of the research projects must be a   community-based participatory research project.  While pilot projects   and the facility core are not required, they are encouraged. </p>
        <p><strong>6.	Is appendix material permitted?</strong> Appendix   material is limited to documentation that demonstrates collaboration   with the Community-Based Participatory Project, e.g., collaborative   manuscripts and preliminary data. </p>
        <p><strong>7.	Since it is not unusual for large applications   such as Centers and Program Projects to be cut in review, what are the   minimum components required for funding eligibility?</strong> The   Administrative Core and three (3) research projects must survive after   review, and one of the research projects must be the community-based   participatory research project.  Note the overall Principal Investigator   is not required to lead one of these projects. </p>
        <p><strong>8.	How important is the Community-Based Participatory Research project?</strong> Applications must propose one project in which academic researchers   work together with community-based organizations.  Applications without a   CBPR component will be considered non-responsive and be returned to the   investigators without further review. Reviewers will look for   documented evidence of existing collaboration.  If such collaboration   appears to have been established just in response to this RFA, the   application will receive a less favorable score.  Such collaboration may   be nascent as long as it is documented.  Applicants are strongly   encouraged to have at least one member of the research team who has such   experience. </p>
        <p><strong>9.	Should P50 applications be designed to be   responsive entirely to NIEHS, NCI or NIA, or may applications propose   research of interest to more than one Institute?</strong> Yes,   applications may propose research of interest to more than one   Institute.  Institute missions and boundaries should not dictate the   science proposed, since there are internal NIH mechanisms for   co-funding. </p>
        <p><strong>10.	Is mental health research permitted?</strong> Yes, the RFA does invite research in areas such as cognition, cognitive   function, cognitive disorders, personality, dementia, Alzheimer's   Disease, and behavioral and affective disorders. </p>
        <p><strong>11.	No mention is made in the RFA to &quot;access to health care.&quot;  Is this research area permitted? </strong> This RFA was not intended to address access to health care issues per   se and while the role of the health care system in contributing to   disparities in disease outcomes is important, it will be supported by   this RFA only when integrated with studies of social and physical   factors. </p>
        <p><strong>12.	Are applications permitted to come in over the budget specified in the RFA (direct costs up to $1.3 million per year)?</strong> While applications may come in over budget, this is strongly   discouraged since no applications will be considered for funding above   this amount.  If an application does come in over the allowable budget,   it will be reduced in review at least to the maximum allowable per the   RFA. </p>
        <p><strong>13.	Is there a required or recommended format for the P50 application?</strong> Yes.  Applications should follow the format described in the    &quot;Supplemental Instructions for Preparation of the Centers for Population   Health and Health Disparities Application &quot; published in the NIH Guide   on 5-29-02  (NOT-ES-02-010)and available at   <a href="/populationhealthcenters/">https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/populationhealthcenters</a>. </p>
        <p><strong>14.  The RFA states that each Center application is   required to have a minimum of three research projects, one of which must   be a community based participatory research (CBPR) project, but the RFA   itself does not specify the required length of each project.  However,   the Supplemental Instructions state that &quot;it is not necessary for all   projects in the CPHHD to span the 5-year period.&quot;  Please clarify this   point.</strong> We apologize for this confusion.  Three (3) research   projects, including the CBPR project, must be concurrently active for a   minimum of 3 years during the five year award period.  Of the 3 required   research projects, the CBPR project and a second project must each be   active for the 5 year period.  The third required research project may   be shorter, but must run at least 3 years.  Beyond the 3 required   projects, other projects may be proposed to run any length of time and   may start in any year.  Please note that ALL research projects, even if   they do not begin in Year 1, must be proposed in the original CPHHD   application.  This does not apply to pilot projects proposed under the   Pilot Project Core, since general conceptual examples of only 2 proposed   pilot studies are to be given.</p>
        <p><strong>15.  Please clarify what is intended by &quot;biological levels of analysis.&quot;</strong> This includes studies that examine functional responses of organ   systems, cells, or molecular pathways to stressors (social/physical   environmental or  behavioral/psychological/cultural). This may include   changes in gene and/or protein expression as well as development and   validation of biomarkers as early indicators or precursors of   modifications in disease pathways involved in response to social and   physical environmental stressors (e.g., signal transduction, apoptosis,   oxidative stress).  While it may be desirable to include biological   levels of analysis within projects, it is not mandatory if   social/environmental levels and behavioral/psychological levels are   addressed.  Each project must address (in any combination) minimally two   of the following levels of analysis:   social/environmental,   behavioral/psychological, or biological.  Please note that while   methodological research is discussed in this section in the RFA, this is   not considered one of the required  &quot;levels of analysis. &quot;    Methodological research is encouraged as an additional research focus   beyond the 2 required levels of analysis.</p>
