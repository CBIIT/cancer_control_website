                <p style="font-style:italic;">Dedra S. Buchwald, MD &#150; Contact Principal Investigator</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract:</span> The University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) will support for a Center for Native Population Health Disparities (CNPHD). Our aim is to directly contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations&#151;populations that are experiencing dramatic health inequities. Although strides have been made in improving health and life expectancy in Native communities, much work remains, as eloquently argued in the Institute of Medicine report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Heath Disparities Research Plan of the National Institutes of Health:  Unfinished Business</span>, and the Surgeon General's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity</span>. Our CNPHD will strive to address the gaps identified in these seminal publications. Our research agenda articulates a model for AI/AN health and health disparities that is well-grounded in current theory, consistent with that of the CPHHD, and applicable to all our projects. The many Native people involved in this Center, as well as our Community Action Board and two AI/AN sociologists, will help us critically examine the role of culture in the model. Our investigations reiterate a single leitmotif&#151;the examination of genetic, environmental, biological, psychosocial, and cultural influences on cancer health disparities at multiple levels and across the lifespan. Our projects include children, youth, and adults. The proposed CNPHD will fill a striking research gap, since no previously or currently funded Center examines AI/AN health disparities. Our Center will truly represent our research partner communities, with 11 AI/ANs serving in key roles, for example as Project and Core Leaders or Co-Investigators. As a result, all proposed projects have deep and meaningful ties to their respective communities. The unique connection between our investigators and the tribal communities imbues our work with a special dynamic. Investigators are more fully invested in the communities with which they work, and this commitment goes a long way to ensuring reciprocity and respect among all parties involved in the research. Finally, the CNPHD will truly be transdisciplinary. We bring together scholars from across the full spectrum of biological, social, and behavioral sciences. Of special note, we do not limit "team science" to traditional academic circles, but bring in ideas and Native expertise from community-based leaders and entities. We envision that this approach will eventually move research on AI/AN health disparities beyond the purely descriptive into meaningful action. The CNPHD will pursue an integrated, multifaceted research program that capitalizes on several large, well-organized, existing efforts and databases, as well as numerous well-established and mutually respectful relationships, to address issues in genetics, etiology, epidemiology, primary and secondary prevention, clinical assessment, treatment, and cancer survivorship. Clinical, basic, and social sciences are linked with a community-based participatory perspective to provide a transdisciplinary research program of the highest scientific and programmatic caliber for AI/AN community members, patients, clinicians, researchers, and health decision-makers. Notably, this application follows the overarching requirements for CPHHD to:  (1) include scientists from basic, clinical, and social sciences; (2) focus on an underserved population; (3) incorporate principles of community-based participatory research; (4) include interventions directed toward at least two levels; (5) offer career development opportunities; and (6) interact and harmonize with other Centers and National Institutes of Health (NIH) program staff to conduct transdisciplinary, multisite, highly interactive research.</p>
