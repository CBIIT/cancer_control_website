      <h2>Public Use Data Sets</h2>
      <p>The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) has the lead responsibility at NCI for supporting research in surveillance, epidemiology, health services, behavioral science, and cancer survivorship. The division also plays a central role within the federal government as a source of expertise and evidence on issues such as the quality of cancer care, the economic burden of cancer, geographic information systems, statistical methods, communication science, tobacco control, and the translation of research into practice. DCCPS staff members are innovators in creating resources for the public and the research community. Below are brief summaries and links to a number of public use data resources available through DCCPS and our partners.</p> 
      
      <p><strong>Surveillance</strong><br />
      HD*Calc<br />
  <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/hdcalc/">http://seer.cancer.gov/hdcalc/</a><br />
      The Health Disparities Calculator (HD*Calc) is designed to generate multiple summary measures to evaluate and monitor health disparities. The HD*Calc statistical software can be used either as an extension of SEER*Stat—allowing users to import Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data—or with other population-based health data.</p>
      
      <p>Small Area Estimates for Cancer Risk Factors &amp; Screening Behaviors<br />
	  <a href="http://sae.cancer.gov/">http://sae.cancer.gov/</a><br />
Model-based estimates for states, counties, and health service areas have been developed based on two surveys, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The two surveys are combined using novel statistical methodology.</p>
      
      <p>Colorectal Cancer Mortality Projections<br />
      <a href="http://cisnet.cancer.gov/projections/colorectal/">http://cisnet.cancer.gov/projections/colorectal/</a><br />
      NCI's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) developed  this Web site to help cancer control planners, program staff, and policy makers  consider the impact of risk factor reduction, increased early detection, and  increased access to optimal treatment on future colorectal cancer mortality  rates.</p>
      
      <p>Cancer Prevalence and Cost of Care Projections<br />
      <a href="http://costprojections.cancer.gov/">http://costprojections.cancer.gov/</a> <br />
      See cost of care or prevalence by  cancer site, sex, age, and year under various assumptions. Cancer  prevalence was estimated and projected by tumor site through 2020 using  incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End  Results (SEER) Program and population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau.  Annualized net costs of care were estimated using Medicare claims linked to  SEER data and adjusted to represent costs in 2010 US dollars. </p>
      
      <p>Finding Cancer Statistics<br />
      <a href="http://surveillance.cancer.gov/statistics/">http://surveillance.cancer.gov/statistics/</a><br />
      Recently developed to facilitate the use of cancer data, Finding Cancer  Statistics is a plain-language Web site that provides access to recent reports,  datasets, and statistical tools for professionals and the general public. It  includes definitions of commonly used statistics, descriptions of datasets and  tools, and guides to their use.</p>

        The recently redesigned SEER Web site is the preferred mechanism for distributing most of the SEER Program's products. Recent additions to the site include the SEER 1975-2009 Cancer Statistics Review, with a search function.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom:6px;"><strong>SEER*Stat</strong><br />
        SEER*Stat is a statistical system for the analysis of SEER and other population-based cancer databases. The system provides an easy-to-use Microsoft Windows desktop package for viewing individual cancer records and for producing statistics to assess the impact of cancer on populations.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom:6px;"><strong>SEER*Prep</strong><br />
        The SEER*Prep system allows users to prepare and format their own cancer incidence, mortality, population, and expected survival rate data for use with SEER*Stat.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom:6px;"><strong>Fast Stats</strong><br />
        Fast Stats uses the Cancer Query System 2.0, CanQues, as an interactive system with Java interface to allow users access to millions of precalculated cancer statistics.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom:6px;"><strong>Cancer Stat Fact Sheets</strong><br />
        Cancer Stat Fact Sheets are a collection of statistical summaries for a number of common cancer types. They were developed to provide a quick overview of frequently requested cancer statistics.</li>

    The Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) is an NCI-sponsored survey of tobacco use and policy information that has been administered as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey since 1992. The TUS-CPS is a key source of national, state, and sub-state level data on smoking and other tobacco use in U.S. households. These data can be used by researchers to monitor progress in the control of tobacco use, conduct tobacco-related research, and evaluate tobacco control programs. </p>
