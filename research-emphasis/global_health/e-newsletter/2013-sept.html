    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Monograph Spotlights Comparative Studies of Cancer Care and Economic Outcomes</span><br />
      Robin Yabroff and  Angela Mariotto led the development of a <em>Journal  of the National Cancer Institute Monograph </em>(<a href="http://jncimono.oxfordjournals.org/content/2013/46.toc" style="color:#02561c">No. 46; August  2013</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a>) entitled &ldquo;Comparing Cancer Care and Economic Outcomes Across Health  Systems:  Challenges and Opportunities.&rdquo;  Written by experts in health economics, epidemiology, health services research,  health policy, and biostatistics, the papers in the monograph highlight the  multiple benefits of comparing patterns of cancer care, costs, and outcomes  across health systems, within a single country or across countries.  Measuring and projecting the economic burden  associated with cancer and identifying effective policies for minimizing its  impact are increasingly important issues for health care policy makers and  health care systems at multiple levels.   The tremendous diversity in health care delivery, expenditures, and  cancer outcomes—both internationally and regionally—suggests that comparative  studies between health care systems and/or countries might inform evaluation,  development, or modification of policies related to cancer screening,  treatment, and programs of care delivery.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">International Cancer Screening Network</span><br />

The project consists of five separate cohort studies, each with its  own principal investigator and history of initial funding.  At the May 2013 meeting, the International  Scientific Advisory Board reviewed progress on recruitment, especially with  respect to respondents with biological specimens, data harmonization, and  analysis and maintenance of biospecimens.&nbsp; In addition, a newly initiated  project to enrich the cohort with cardiovascular risk factor data was reviewed  and discussed.&nbsp; Finally, the board discussed the plan for making cohort  data available as a population laboratory in Canada and the enrichment of the  cohort data with diet and activity data.</p>
         <p> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">NCI-Europe  Collaboration Focuses on GVHD<br />
         </span>In 2012, a NCI initiative sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/globalhealth" style="color:#02561c">NCI Center for Global Health</a> launched a <a href="http://www.ebmt.org/" style="color:#02561c">European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a>-wide (55 countries) effort focused on advancing education and training  in graft versus host disease (GVHD), with a particular emphasis on chronic GVHD  (cGVHD), the most prominent late effect in cancer survivors after allogeneic  transplant. The ultimate goal is to develop a mechanism that will facilitate  the understanding and overcoming of great disparities in post-transplant care  and research across Europe as well as advance research in this area by  fostering collaborations on both sides of the Atlantic. Post-allogeneic  transplant survivorship is an attractive model to study cancer survivorship due  to the abundant medical and quality-of-life issues in these patients.</p>
         <p>Since the December 2012 project development meeting, in which experts  from NCI participated, including Julia Rowland, Russ Glasgow, Sandra Mitchell,  and a representative from the <a href="http://rarediseasesnetwork.epi.usf.edu/cGVHD/index.htm" title="Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) Consortium" style="color:#02561c">Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease Consortium</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a> (which receives funding and/or programmatic support from  NCI&rsquo;s DCTD and the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research), the NCI-Europe collaborative group has conducted  a descriptive study of the uptake and use of recommendations for diagnosis,  severity scoring, and management of chronic GVHD; this publication will be  forthcoming. Building on the project development meeting and the study  findings, an R21 grant application is currently in development to study the  international dissemination and implementation of guideline-concordant care for  people with chronic GVHD, with Stephanie Lee, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research  Center, as principal investigator.  Sandra  Mitchell continues to be involved as an NCI expert.</p>
