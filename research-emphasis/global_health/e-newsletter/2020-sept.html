<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">International Guideline Harmonization Group for the Metabolic Syndrome </strong></p>
<p> Emily Tonorezos, the new director of NCI&rsquo;s Office of Cancer Survivorship, is co-leader of the International Guideline Harmonization Group for the Metabolic Syndrome, along with Janine Nuver of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. This effort develops evidence-based international guidelines for adult survivors of pediatric cancer (<a style="color: #02561c;" href="http://www.ighg.org">www.ighg.org</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html" class="add-on" title="External Link"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer"></a>).</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Spanish-Language Version of NCCOR Resource</strong></p>
<p> The National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research (NCCOR) has released a <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://www.nccor.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NCCOR-YouthComp-ES-Final.pdf">Spanish language version of its popular Youth Compendium of Physical Activities</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html" class="add-on" title="External Link"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer"></a> resource. The Youth Compendium of Physical Activities provides a list of 196 common activities in which youth participate and the estimated energy cost associated with each activity. The Spanish version includes activities common in Spain, Mexico, and Colombia. This resource was translated in response to the rise of childhood obesity in Latin America and a need identified by NCCOR members and Latin American researchers for a tool to help address the growing epidemic. David Berrigan and Kathy Watson (CDC) spearheaded this effort.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">SBM-NCI Collaborative Effort on Health Behavior and Climate Change</strong></p>
<p> Susan Czajkowski, Kara Hall, and Pat Boyd, partnered with the Society of Behavioral Medicine&rsquo;s (SBM&rsquo;s) Immediate Past President Michael Diefenbach to plan a webinar in July 2020, titled &ldquo;The Fundamentals of Climate Change and Health Behavior Change.&rdquo; The panel of leading international experts presented research on the intersection of climate change and health behavior change. This webinar is the first in a series for an SBM-NCI collaborative effort to advance research that can help individuals and communities engage in behaviors that synergistically benefit both human health and the global environment. Dr. Hall is leading the development of the second webinar in this series, &ldquo;Climate Change, Behavior Change, and Health: Tackling Global Challenges Together,&rdquo; which is focused on advancing transdisciplinary climate change, behavior change, and health research. The webinar will take place in early Fall. Additionally, Dr. Hall is serving as co-chair of the SBM Presidential Working Group onClimate Change, Behavior Change, and Health<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">International Initiative on Interoception in the Service of Allostasis </strong></p>
<p> DCCPS staff, including Paige Green, are involved in a work group on the Interoception in the Service of Allostasis initiative, which aims to identify research gaps and advance fundamental knowledge of interoception in the service of predictive energy regulation. The work group is chaired by Lisa Barrett and Karen Quigley, both from Northeastern University, and includes some international scientists at the leading edge of basic interoception science.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">US Embassy Science Fellowship </strong></p>
<p> Pam Marcus was awarded a US Embassy Science Fellowship and spent 5 weeks in January and February 2020 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. She was posted at the US Embassy Kolonia and spent most of her time investigating betel nut chewing habits and the emerging oral cavity cancer problem. She developed a betel nut use and attitudes questionnaire, which was completed by the 18 Embassy Guards. While in Pohnpei, Pam met with leaders in the state and national health departments, as well as public health students at the National Campus of the College of Micronesia, and attended a workshop on the roll-out of data from a 2019 study on risk factors for non-communicable diseases. She also experienced the fanfare that accompanies the departure of one US Ambassador and the arrival of another. Pam&rsquo;s favorite part of her visit was spending time with Pohnpeians and answering their questions about cancer and health, and taking care of the four 2-month-old Embassy kittens (Zoey, Zander, Zelda, and Rocky). Non-work-related major accomplishments included developing a taste for raw tuna and driving a Ford Explorer. </p>

<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">ICARE Survey</strong></p>
<p> Susan Czajkowski and Sudha Sivaram (NCI&rsquo;s Center for Global Health [CGH]) have provided comments to the Montreal Behavioural Medicine Center and helped disseminate an international survey called ICARE, developed to gather data on preventive behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions related to COVID-19 across a diverse array of 38 countries. The survey is available in 36 languages, and a third wave of the survey is currently being disseminated globally.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Pre-application Webinar and FOA on Global Tobacco Research</strong></p>
<p> The Center for Global Health (CGH) in collaboration with DCCPS released a funding opportunity announcement, &ldquo;Tobacco Use and HIV in Low- and Middle-Income Countries&rdquo; (<a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-20-037.html">RFA-CA-20-037</a>), for transdisciplinary teams to conduct research supporting the development and evaluation of tobacco cessation interventions tailored to people living with HIV (PLWH) in one or more low- and middle-income countries. A pre-application webinar was held on August, 17, 2020, and materials are available <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cgh/research-training/tobacco-hiv-webinar-slides.pdf">online</a>. Applications are due September 24, 2020. </p>

<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">International Behavioural Trials Network Conference </strong></p>
<p> Susan Czajkowski moderated a session on &ldquo;Behavioural Solutions for Global Challenges – Health and Climate Change&rdquo; for the <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://www.ibtnetwork.org/conference/">International Behavioural Trials Network virtual conference</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html" class="add-on" title="External Link"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer"></a> on May 28, 2020. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Third International HundredK+ Cohort Consortium (IHCC) Summit</strong></p>
<p> Nonye Harvey, Joanne Elena, and Kathy Helzlsouer represented the NCI Cohort Consortium (an affiliate member of the IHCC) at the <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://ihccglobal.org/third-international-cohorts-summit/">3rd International Cohorts Summit</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html" class="add-on" title="External Link"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" width="12" height="12" alt="exit disclaimer"></a>, held virtually May 4-5, 2020. The summit was hosted by the Global Genomic Collaborative in collaboration with the US National Human Genomic Research Institute (NHGRI). The summit brought together approximately 160 scientists from more than 23 countries to discuss ongoing and new areas for collaborative research in large-scale prospective cohort studies involving at least 100,000 study participants. Discussion during the summit led to several key actions: to galvanize around the consortium&rsquo;s visionary charter, to mobilize global efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, to introduce the IHCC to a Cohort Data Atlas to facilitate cross-cohort collaborations, and to engage the full membership in developing a scientific agenda that would leverage the cohorts and data in advancing key global research priorities. </p>
