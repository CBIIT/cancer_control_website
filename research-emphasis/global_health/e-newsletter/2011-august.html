The division conducts and supports an integrated program of the  highest-quality genetic, epidemiological, behavioral, social, applied, and  surveillance cancer research in the United States and internationally. DCCPS-funded  international research aims to monitor and explain the causes and distribution  of cancer in populations throughout the world and to support the development  and delivery of effective interventions. Many of us at DCCPS have played a  leading role in the effort to address cancer burden globally, through our many  collaborations within NCI, NIH, or other organizations working to improve the  health of populations worldwide. I hope that you will find this newsletter an  informative and valuable resource as you continue to move forward with your  global health activities.</p>
