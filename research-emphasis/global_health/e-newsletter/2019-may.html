     <p> <strong style="color: #02561c;">New Canadian Version of ASA24 for Dietary Assessment in Research Studies</strong></p>
     <p> In April 2019, a new Canadian version of the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool was released. The Canadian adaptation of ASA24 utilizes the infrastructure created for the US version of ASA24 that NCI developed and maintains.  </p>
     <p>ASA24-Canada includes modifications that reflect the Canadian food supply. The Canadian version of ASA24 makes it possible for researchers to collect dietary recall and food record data in a range of studies in Canada using a tool tailored to the Canadian context. For example, study participants can complete food records or dietary recalls through the web-based Respondent website in either English or French. The latest updates to ASA24-Canada include an optional Respondent Nutrition Report (RNR) that researchers can choose to make available to study participants. The RNR provides feedback to study participants regarding how their dietary intake on a given reporting day compares to Canadian dietary guidance and nutrient requirements.</p>
     <p>The development of the Canadian versions of ASA24 has been supported by Health Canada&rsquo;s Food Directorate, the Alberta Cancer Foundation, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer through funds allocated to Alberta&rsquo;s Tomorrow Project, and contributions from researchers at the University of Waterloo.</p>
     <p>More information about ASA24, including ASA24-Canada, can be found at <a style="color: #02561c;" href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/">http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/</a>.</p>

     <p> <strong style="color: #02561c;">CARPHA Virtual Training Sessions for Cancer Registries</strong></p>
     <p> In collaboration with the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) Hub for cancer registries in the Caribbean, <a style="color: #02561c;" name="_Hlk522891303">on April 17, 2019, Goncalo Forjaz de Lacerda</a> presented a webinar on multiple primary cancers, which was one of four weekly virtual training sessions on cancer coding (topography, morphology) and staging. All webinars are recorded and will be archived on the <a style="color: #02561c;" href="http://caribbeancrh.carpha.org/">CARPHA Hub</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> and the NAACCR websites later this month.</p>
     <p><strong style="color: #02561c;">CanTest International School for Cancer Detection Research in Primary Care</strong></p>
     <p> Cancer Prevention Fellow Elizabeth Sarma was recently invited to attend the 2nd CanTest International School for Cancer Detection Research in Primary Care at the University of Cambridge, UK, for one week in April. At the school, Dr. Sarma received training in methods relevant for early detection research. The overall CanTest vision is to transform the primary care physician&rsquo;s office into a hub of diagnostic excellence for patients who may have undiagnosed cancer. The aims of the International School are threefold: to identify and evaluate the potential of existing and emerging diagnostic technologies and biomarkers; to consider the assessment of symptomatic populations and identification of populations at higher risk of cancer; and to enhance understanding of how to assess the performance, safety, patient and physician acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of cancer tests in primary care. Formal presentations and small-group workshops focused on data collection and research methods, analyses of large data sets, health economics, and mixed methods research. Additionally, school attendees gave presentations of their work and received feedback from the international panel of senior faculty. The one-week training provided a unique experience for Dr. Sarma to build methodological skills and collaborative relationships with international scientists in early detection research.</p>

     <p> <strong style="color: #02561c;">Eastern Caribbean Oncology Network Meeting</strong></p>
     <p> On April 27, 2019, Brenda K. Edwards attended a meeting of the Eastern Caribbean Oncology Network to co-present and discuss CARPHA&rsquo;s approach for a regional registry system appropriate for the OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) island countries. Development of the approach included discussions with the Pacific Regional Central Cancer Registry (a CDC-funded registry; PI: Lee Buenconsejo-Lum). Dr. Edwards is traveling with the cancer registry site assessment team to Georgetown, Guyana, for their May 2-3 meeting, and will conduct follow-up assessments on the Trinidad and Togabo Cancer Registry in Port of Spain. </p>
     <p><strong style="color: #02561c;">European-US Workshop on Cancer Recurrence and Registry Data</strong></p>
     <p> Lynne Penberthy, Kathy Cronin, Serban Negoita, and Angela Mariotto attended the European-US Workshop on Cancer Recurrence and Registry Data, held March 11-12, 2019, in London. The workshop brought together surveillance researchers who are developing methodologies for capturing recurrence. Along with DCCPS, CDC, Utah Cancer Registry, and US academic centers, participants included researchers from England, Northern Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Australia. Attendees agreed on the need for a standard, global definition of recurrence and new automated methods for collecting recurrence information from various data sources. </p>
     <p><strong style="color: #02561c;">American Psychosomatic Society Annual Meeting</strong></p>
     <p> Paige Green and Jennifer Guida attended the <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://www.psychosomatic.org/anmeeting/2019annualmeeting.cfm">77th Annual Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>, held March 6-9, 2019, in Vancouver, BC. Dr. Green co-chaired a symposium titled &ldquo;A mechanism-focused approach to behavioral intervention research: promoting health by engaging key underlying processes,&rdquo; which included speakers from Columbia University Medical Center, Brown University, and the University of Pittsburgh. She also provided opening remarks for the lecture by Patricia R. Barchas Award winner Steve Cole of UCLA, titled &ldquo;Human social genomics.&rdquo; In a paper session on depression, Dr. Guida spoke about frailty and the various health outcomes it can predict in a presentation titled &ldquo;Baseline frailty predicts sleep fragmentation, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms: Results from a nationally representative prospective cohort of older adults.&rdquo;</p>
