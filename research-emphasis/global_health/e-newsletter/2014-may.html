<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Trans-NIH Clean Cookstoves Initiative </span><br />
  Gila Neta is working with Fogarty International Center (FIC) to develop an  Implementation Science Network and possible RFA to better understand and  improve adoption and use of clean cookstoves internationally, as part of the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.fic.nih.gov/News/GlobalHealthMatters/Oct2010/Pages/cookstove.aspx">Trans-NIH  Clean Cookstoves Initiative</a>. Josh Rosenthal at FIC is the lead. Britt Reid,  who has been the NCI contact on the initiative, recently engaged Dr. Neta&rsquo;s  expertise because of the recent interest in implementation science within the  Clean Cookstoves Initiative to look at adoption and use issues.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Global Environmental and Occupational  Health Program</span><br />
  The  Fogarty International Center (FIC), in partnership with the National Institute  of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and CDC&rsquo;s National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), launched a program to support the  development of leading institutions in the developing world that serve as  regional hubs for collaborative research, data management, training, curriculum  development, and policy support. The <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.fic.nih.gov/News/GlobalHealthMatters/september-october-2102/Pages/geohealth-grant-awards.aspx">Global  Environmental and Occupational Health (GEOHealth) program</a> was developed to  address the need to build a critical mass of first-class scientists in low- and  middle-income countries (LMICs) with support and recognition from national  governments. A GEOHealth Network meeting was held February 25-26, 2014, at NIH  that brought together GEOHealth planning grantees to share accomplishments and  challenges, discuss collaborative opportunities, interact with NIH staff and  representatives from GEOHealth funding partners, and learn about other relevant  opportunities. Damali Martin provided opening remarks on behalf of NCI and Gary  Ellison moderated a scientific session on LMIC challenges and opportunities in  environmental and occupational health knowledge synthesis, with a focus on data  sharing, access, integration, and management. It is likely that lessons learned  from the meeting would be helpful in developing an anticipated full GEOHealth  Hub program.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">China Smoking Cessation Program using  Text Messages</span><br />
  The China Smoking Cessation Program using  Text Messages project will assist in determining the potential effectiveness  and acceptability of a health-based short message service (SMS) messaging  program within China&rsquo;s large population of smokers. If effective, text-based  programs would provide a low-cost means to increase public education and  knowledge on the harmful effects of smoking, and also to deliver a smoking  cessation intervention. Two projects have been completed. The first was a two-arm  trial in collaboration with a team from Emory University that occurred in  conjunction with an annual Quit Smoking Context in the city of Suzhou.  Approximately 650 smokers received cessation text messages as part of the  contest while a control group did not. The second project was a collaboration  between HHS, China Ministry of Health (MOH), and Nokia. The two-arm randomized  control trial of a smoking cessation text messaging program was launched in  April 2013 and recruited over 8,000 smokers in a single day. The study included  3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments, with data collection completed in  December 2013. The data from both studies support the use of mobile health  (mHealth) as a means to deliver smoking cessation treatment. A third study in  China, again in collaboration with the team from Emory, is underway exploring  the possible benefit of including cessation text messages as part of an  intervention to reduce secondhand smoke exposure in infants.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">China-US  Workplace Partnership</span><br />
  The 2010 China Global Adult Tobacco Survey  showed that 63% of people reported exposure to second-hand smoke in the  workplace within the past 30 days. On August 18, 2012, the governments of China  and the US issued a Joint Statement initiating a partnership &ldquo;to help companies  to establish 100% smoke-free workplaces and create a supportive atmosphere [for]  tobacco control efforts.&rdquo; China&rsquo;s Center for Disease Control is the lead agency  in China for implementation of the initiative, and NCI has provided substantial  technical assistance throughout the process. Participation in the initiative  has grown to a list of over 275 companies. NCI has also played a key role in  developing training materials and workshops to assist companies in implementing  smoke-free policies and programs and is also assisting in evaluating the program&rsquo;s  impact. In March 2014 the US Embassy in Beijing kicked off its own smoking  cessation program for embassy staff, including use of NCI&rsquo;s text messaging-based  cessation tools in English and Mandarin. Mark Parascandola is spending 3 months  in Beijing on an Embassy Science Fellowship during spring 2013 to provide  support to the China-US Workplace Partnership. </p>

  Sandra  Mitchell and Kate Castro are collaborating with investigators at the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/">University of  Basel</a> in Switzerland and the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National  University of Singapore</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> to develop and  preliminarily validate language translations of the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/">Patient-Reported  Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (PRO-CTCAE)</a> item library. The German  language version of PRO-CTCAE has been linguistically validated by  investigators at the University of Basel in collaboration with Outcomes  Research Branch staff, and a publication reporting the results of that  validation effort and the development of a transplant survivor-specific  PRO-CTCAE item bundle is in preparation. </p>
<p>The  branch is also collaborating with a team at the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/the-university">University of Bonn</a> to conduct a quantitative validation study of the  PRO-CTCAE German version.  Study accrual  (patients with solid tumors receiving cancer treatment) is complete and branch  staff are participating in data analysis and manuscript preparation.  A key step in promoting widespread  implementation of PRO-CTCAE in both international and US trials is the  availability of translated and linguistically and culturally adapted instrument  versions. Under the terms of material transfer agreements negotiated with these  investigators through the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://techtransfer.cancer.gov/">NCI Technology  Transfer Center (TTC</a>), branch staff can distribute the translated item  libraries to other national and international investigators who are interested  in using PRO-CTCAE in their studies.</p>
