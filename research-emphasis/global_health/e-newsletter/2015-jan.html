<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">The International Consortium for Action and Research on Tobacco</span><br />
On December 5, 2014, at the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.worldcancercongress.org/melbourne-2014">World Cancer  Congress</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a> in Melbourne, Australia, NCI joined with  other cancer research funding organizations to launch a collaborative effort to  enhance tobacco control research capacity in low- and middle-income countries. The International Consortium for Action and Research on Tobacco will  work to increase coordination and collaboration across research funders, to  develop and promote a joint research agenda, and to increase investment in the  evidence-base for tobacco control. While the Framework Convention for Tobacco  Control and funding efforts from the Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill and  Melinda Gates Foundation have greatly strengthened international tobacco  control advocacy and policies, ongoing research is needed to provide continued  support for effective tobacco control efforts and evaluate their impact. Along  with NCI, partners include Cancer Research UK, the UICC, Cancer Council  Australia and Cancer Council Victoria, The McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer,  Irish Cancer Society, the French Institut National du Cancer, Norwegian Cancer  Society, The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, and Latin American &amp; Caribbean  Society of Medical Oncology<strong> </strong></p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Global Smoking  Attributable Mortality</span><br />
  Currently,  tobacco use contributes to 6 million deaths every year and is predicted to  increase to 8 million deaths every year by 2030, with 80% of these deaths  occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The existing methodology  has been used to generate accurate estimates in the United States, but without  country-specific data for other regions, it is currently not accurately transferable  to generate estimates for other countries. The purpose of this initiative, led  by the US CDC, is to bring together a wide range of international partners and  experts to develop a direct method that estimates smoking-attributable  mortality, by using existing national (high-income) smoking-attributable  mortality (SAM) methodologies and translating them onto a global scale, by  country, starting in select middle-income countries and continuing worldwide.  Eleven middle-income countries have been tentatively identified for the initial  stage of the project, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico,  Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Egypt. Mark Parascandola  joined the planning committee for this initiative and participated in a  kick-off meeting in Toronto, Canada, October 8-10, 2014. </p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">China-US  Smokefree Workplace Initiative</span><br />
  The  US Department of Health and Human Services and the China CDC launched the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.globalhealth.gov/world-regions/asia-and-pacific/uschina.html">China-US  Smokefree Workplace (CUSW) initiative</a> 2 years ago as a public-private partnership  to assist companies in creating healthy, smokefree workplaces for their  employees. NCI provides technical and staff support to the CUSW and is  currently participating in planning for a series of cessation training  workshops for physicians in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Qingdao in 2015. The  workshops are supported by a grant from Global Bridges and the Pfizer  Foundation. Additionally, NCI is leading an evaluation of the CUSW initiative  for future publication. </p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Emory  University&rsquo;s Collaboration with NCI on Reducing the Secondhand Smoke Exposure  in Newborns in China</span><br />
  Emory  University is using NCI-developed mHealth smoking cessation resources as one  element of a multi-layered project. The project recruited participants and  launched in October 2014. It consists of a three-arm trial investigating  strategies to reduce infants&rsquo; exposure to secondhand smoke within the home. The  primary goal is to help create smoke-free homes through 1) standard education  taught in group prenatal classes, 2) individual education with women and their  partners about the health risks of secondhand smoke, and 3) enhanced education  plus smoking cessation support via the SmokefreeTXT China program. One of the  goals of the project is to assess the potential added benefit of the enhanced  treatments.</p>

<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Data  to Action in Tobacco Control Workshop</span><br />
NCI Tobacco Control Research Branch and the Center  for Global Heath organized a one-day workshop prior to the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.worldcancercongress.org/melbourne-2014">World Cancer Congress</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a> in Melbourne, Australia, on December 2,  2014.<strong> </strong>Faculty included members from Cancer Council Victoria, Cancer  Research UK, Public Health Foundation of India, and NCI. Participants  represented a variety of countries including Argentina, Indonesia, Kenya,  Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, Turkey, and Zambia. The primary goals of  the workshop were to 1) highlight the important role surveillance and  investigation have in policy change; 2) discuss ways to link data and research  with advocacy action; and 3) provide tools for developing capacity for data  analysis, research, and dissemination in tobacco control. This data-to-action  training focused on using existing data and building research capacity to  support local and national tobacco control policies and programs consistent  with the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO  FCTC) and MPOWER strategies. The workshop also provided an opportunity for  networking among national and international tobacco control experts. <strong></strong></p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">WHO-International  Telecommunication Union (ITU) Workshop</span><br />

<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">&lsquo;Smokeless  Tobacco and Public Health: A Global Perspective&rsquo; Report</span><br />
  This first-ever report on the global use and impact of  smokeless tobacco finds that more than 300 million people in at least 70  countries use these products. <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/global-perspective/index.html">The report</a>, <em>Smokeless  Tobacco and Public Health: A Global Perspective</em>, was released by the CDC  and NCI at the National Conference on Smoking or Health in Mumbai, India, on  December 15, 2014. Representatives from the Government of India and the World  Health Organization  participated in the  release and accompanying scientific symposium. Thirty-two leading experts from  around the world contributed to the report. In addition to detailing the  serious and well-documented health effects of smokeless tobacco products, the report  also examines the distinct challenges and policy solutions in reducing the  burden of smokeless tobacco use.  For  example, a wide range of smokeless tobacco products with different  characteristics are in use around the world, yet limited data is available detailing  the contents of these products, how they&rsquo;re used, and their prevalence within  different population groups. The report identifies key research gaps and makes  recommendations for capacity building in research and surveillance of smokeless  tobacco use, with the aim of reducing the burden of smokeless tobacco use  worldwide.</p>

  Sandra Mitchell attended the annual research meeting of the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.isoqol.org/2014conference">International Society of Quality of Life</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a> (ISOQOL) in Berlin, Germany, October 15-18, 2014.&nbsp;  Dr. Mitchell and the research team developing the Patient-Reported Outcomes  Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)  delivered three podium presentations and two posters.&nbsp; PRO-CTCAE study  findings disseminated in the ISOQOL presentations included the results of a linguistic  validation of the Spanish language version of the PRO-CTCAE, results of an  analysis examining the responsiveness of PRO-CTCAE items to detect between-group  differences, and an analysis of the patterns of PRO-CTCAE alerts for severe  symptoms that were generated in a randomized cancer treatment trial.&nbsp; One  of the two poster presentations focused on the feasibility of implementing  PRO-CTCAE in a multi-site randomized trial in radiation therapy, while the  other compared various PRO-CTCAE recall periods (7 days vs. 14 days vs. 28  days). Dr. Mitchell also co-authored a presentation with Bill Wood and Antonia  Bennett, who are PRO-CTCAE early adopters at the University of North  Carolina.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presentation examined the association between  symptomatic toxicities, pedometry values, and patient self-reports of physical  activity, self-assessed health, and quality of life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dr.  Mitchell also met with several early adopters of PRO-CTCAE, including  collaborators who are implementing PRO-CTCAE in cancer clinical trials and  routine practice in the United Kingdom, representatives from the Danish Cancer  Society who are translating PRO-CTCAE into Danish and conducting a linguistic  validation, and a team from Germany who are planning to use PRO-CTCAE to  characterize symptomatic treatment toxicity in women receiving treatment for  metastatic breast cancer. </p>
<p>A  key step in promoting widespread implementation of PRO-CTCAE in both  international and US trials is the availability of translated and  linguistically and culturally adapted instrument versions.&nbsp; In addition,  feasibility trials using varied study designs and in diverse contexts of use  will provide important information to enhance adoption of PRO-CTCAE around the  world.&nbsp; These collaborations are structured under the terms of Material  Transfer Agreements negotiated with investigators through the NCI Office of  Technology Transfer.&nbsp; Robert Wagner (NCI Office of Technology Transfer)  and Kate Castro (ORB) work closely with Dr. Mitchell to establish these  agreements and to coordinate the work conducted by these early adopters.
