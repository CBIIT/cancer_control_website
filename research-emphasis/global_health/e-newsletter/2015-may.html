<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">ASA24 in Canada  and Australia</span><br />
  Canadian adaptation of the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/">Automated Self-Administered  24-hour Recall</a> has been developed by the Food  Directorate at Health Canada in collaboration with DCCPS, under the guidance of  Amy Subar. ASA24-Canada makes use of the ASA24 Respondent and Researcher websites,  with modifications made to reflect the Canadian food supply. Foods unique to  Canada have been added and those not available in Canada removed. Many changes  reflect differences in brand name and fast-food restaurant items between the  two countries. Metric measurements have been added as well. Although  researchers can begin to collect 24-hour recall data using ASA24-Canada, work  is underway to incorporate Canadian nutrient data into the ASA24 analytic  modules for computing energy and nutrient intakes from foods and drinks  reported on ASA24 recalls. This database work is funded through a grant to  Alberta's Tomorrow Project, with in-kind support from the Food Directorate at  Health Canada. The project is expected to reach completion later this year.</p>
<p>Work is underway with a consortium of  Australian researchers to adapt the ASA24 to the Australian context to account  for variations in food consumed, portion sizes, and nutrient composition.  Adaptation of the US version will be guided by the most recent Australian  Health Survey and linked to food codes in the Australian Food, Supplement and  Nutrient Database (AUSNUT) 2011-13. The project, led by Associate Professor Sarah  McNaughton (Centre for Physical Activity and Nutrition Research [C-PAN], Deakin  University), brings together five Australian institutions with major research  programs in nutrition: Deakin University, University of Newcastle, University  of Sydney, University of Wollongong, and the Commonwealth Scientific and  Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The project is supported by an  Australian Research Council Linkage, Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities  Grant (LE140100099). The Australian version is expected to be completed by the  end of 2016.</p>
