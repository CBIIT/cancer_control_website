Indoor air pollution (IAP) derived largely from the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating affects approximately 3 billion people worldwide, resulting in substantial adverse health outcomes, including cancer. A workshop was held in Arlington, Virginia, May 9-11, 2011, to better understand women's and children's potential health effects from IAP in developing countries. Workshop participants included international scientists, manufacturers, policy and regulatory officials, community leaders, and advocates, who held extensive discussions to help identify future research needs.  In commentary published in November 2012, the state of the science in understanding IAP and its associations with cancer is described and research opportunities are identified for improving understanding of the issues. IAP from indoor coal use increases the risk of lung cancer. Installing chimneys can reduce risk, and some genotypes, including GSTM1-null, can increase risk. Additional research is needed regarding the effects of IAP on other cancers and the effects of different types of solid fuels, oral and dermal routes of IAP exposure, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and genetic susceptibility.

    <p><a name="5" id="five"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">The Cancer and Primary Care Research International Network (Ca-PRI) Meets in Australia</span><br>
DCCPS’ Stephen Taplin and Carrie Klabunde, along with David Weller of Scotland, organized a meeting that brought together 75 investigators from Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada, and Latin America to discuss primary care’s involvement in cancer screening.  The session was held on October 23, 2012, in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.cancermeetings.org/ICSN2012/" title="International Cancer Screening Network biennial meeting in Sydney, Australia."><span style="color:#099835">International Cancer Screening Network biennial meeting in Sydney, Australia.</span></a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>  Stephen Taplin, as well as investigators from Canada, Costa Rica, the United Kingdom, and Australia, each made a presentation regarding the role of primary care in cancer screening in their country.  Discussion among the 75 investigators emphasized the various levels of independence and integration between primary care and organized screening around the world, the challenge of follow-up on abnormalities if organized programs don’t do it themselves, and the relatively high rate of screening within the United States, despite the absence of organized screening programs.  Carrie Klabunde and Stephen Taplin will be working with colleagues on an international collaborative paper related to these topics.<br><br>

Dr. Taplin also participated in the planning meeting for the <a href="http://ca-pri.org/" title="Ca-PRI meeting that will be held in Cambridge, UK, in April 2013"><span style="color:#099835">Ca-PRI meeting that will be held in Cambridge, UK, in April 2013</span></a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>  He and others are planning a session for the 2013 meeting that will focus on early detection in European countries.

    <p><a name="7" id="seven"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">International Cancer Screening Network Holds Biennial Meeting in Australia</span><br>
The <a href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/icsn/" title="International Cancer Screening Network (ICSN)"><span style="color:#099835">International Cancer Screening Network (ICSN)</span></a> is a voluntary consortium of 33 countries that have active population-based cancer screening programs and active efforts to evaluate and improve the processes and outcomes from cancer screening in practice. The ICSN includes efforts to evaluate cancer screening for a number of cancers where screening has been demonstrated to be effective, including breast, colon, cervical, and lung cancers.<br><br>
The ICSN convened its most recent <a href="http://www.cancermeetings.org/ICSN2012/" ><span style="color:#099835" title="biennial meeting">biennial meeting</span></a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> on October 23-25 in Sydney, Australia, in conjunction with the Sydney International Breast Cancer Congress. Nearly 180 cancer screening researchers, evaluators, and program leads from 24 countries attended the three-day meeting. <br><br>
Scientific presentations focused on the following topics:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span style="color:#000000; font:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px;">Evaluating new technologies and their readiness for incorporation into cancer screening programs</span> </li>
      <li><span style="color:#000000; font:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px;">Benefits, harms, and costs of cancer screening programs, and factors that influence policy and decision-making about screening programs</span></li>
      <li><span style="color:#000000; font:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px;">Roles of allied health professionals and lay health workers in cancer screening</span></li>
      <li><span style="color:#000000; font:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px;">Feasible technology approaches to screening in low-resource countries</span></li>
      </ul>
    <p>Key issues that emerged from the sessions included the need for accurate measures of cancer screening’s harms and benefits so that meaningful comparisons across programs and countries can be made; identifying ways to reduce false positives, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment; how to implement individualized screening within population-based programs; incorporating comorbidity into determinations of stopping ages for cancer screening; evaluating cervical cancer screening strategies in the presence of HPV vaccination and testing; use of specific technologies and non-physician health workers to deliver cancer screening in low-resource countries; and integrating research into screening programs and practice.<br><br>
Stephen Taplin and Erica Breslau participated in the meeting.  In addition, two papers on the detection and management of ductal carcinoma in situ, which Dr. Taplin has been working on with colleagues from Europe, were also presented.  Dr. Taplin facilitated a session that included 10 papers addressing the benefits, harms, and costs of screening programs. Half of the papers used mathematical modeling as a method to estimate effects, adding impetus to the work of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) and others to increase modeling efforts in the United States.  Dr. Breslau presented a poster regarding using a prognostic indicator to facilitate a discussion of screening and targeting it appropriately among older adults.  After the meeting, Dr. Breslau presented on the same topic for staff at St. Vincent’s hospital in Sydney.<br><br>
The scientific sessions were further augmented by a day of meetings devoted to the ICSN’s <a href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/icsn/projects/" title="four working groups and two interest groups"><span style="color:#099835">four working groups and two interest groups</span></a>.  The ICSN members decided to meet next in 2015 in the Netherlands, with the cancer screening unit of Erasmus University Medical Center to co-host the meeting with NCI.

    <p><a name="8" id="eight"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">University of Newcastle and St. Vincent’s Hospital Australia</span><br>
Erica Breslau presented on quality of care and work at NCI to researchers and faculty at the University of Newcastle, Research Center for Health Behaviour.  She met with Dr. Rob Sanson-Fisher and others to discuss research projects that ranged from understanding determinants of clinical network success, to improving psychosocial outcomes for cancer patients, to delay in seeking treatment for colorectal cancer among older adults.  Dr. Breslau will continue to explore potential collaborations that use data systems to evaluate problems and successes in care when patients move from screening to diagnosis, treatment to survivorship, or survivorship to end of life. </p>
    
    <p><a name="9" id="nine"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Flinders University, Australia</span><br>
  Stephen Taplin was invited to speak at Flinders University, where he presented two papers: 1) the challenges of communicating screening guidelines based on experience with the 2009 United States Preventive Services Task Force report on mammography, and 2) multilevel interventions in health care delivery.  While there, he also met with representatives of organized screening programs for breast and colorectal cancers. Dr. Taplin learned about the data systems and potential for collaboration with researchers in Australia who are interested in improving primary care involvement in their screening programs. Despite having organized screening in Australia, there are relatively low participation rates (60%) and a lack of clarity regarding the proportion of people with abnormal screenings who are appropriately evaluated.  The findings and challenges are relevant to NCI's Population-Based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) initiative.</p>
    
    <p><a name="10" id="ten"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Caribbean Regional Interest Group Aims to Strengthen Cancer Registries, Cancer Prevention, Research, and Training</span><br>
The co-chairs of the Caribbean Regional Interest Group, Damali Martin (EGRP) and John Flanigan (CGH), along with Somdat Mahabir (EGRP) visited four Caribbean nations (Grenada, Barbados, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago) to assess avenues for strengthening cancer registries, cancer prevention activities, and research and training collaborations.  They met with several key stakeholders including academic researchers from St. George’s University and the University of the West Indies, cancer registrars, ministers for health, chief medical officers, representatives from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Caribbean Health Research Council, and Dr. Rudolph Cummings, the program manager for Health Sector Development for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).  Drs. Martin, Flanigan, and Mahabir promoted immediate efforts for strengthening registries in the Caribbean.  They assessed needs for cancer registry development and cancer prevention programs at Ministries for Health and also investigated possible collaborations for research and training capacity building for Caribbean universities in general as well as for specific projects.<br><br>

Drs. Martin and Flanigan also met with key stakeholders for cancer research and cancer prevention and control planning in The Bahamas and appeared on a one-hour talk show to discuss issues surrounding prostate cancer in men of African descent.  Future plans for building capacity in the Caribbean include increasing attendance of Caribbean nationals at the NCI’s Summer Curriculum for Cancer Prevention and planning a workshop on non-communicable disease surveillance this February in Miami, Florida.  Goals include assessing the needs, challenges, and opportunities associated with the establishment of regional cancer registry training; collaboration among key stakeholders in the Caribbean; and discussing opportunities and challenges for expanding from cancer surveillance to non-communicable disease surveillance in the Caribbean.<br><br>

Brenda Edwards also participated in the conference as a resource expert on cancer surveillance.  In addition, Dr. Edwards presented a talk entitled "Important Elements of Cancer Registries in Resource Challenged Settings" at the November 1 Conference Workshop.

<p><a name="14" id="fourteen"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Croatia-United States Workshop on Cancer Prevention</span><br>
Mark Parascandola participated in the Croatia-United States Workshop on Cancer Prevention via Tobacco Control and Smoking Cessation in Zagreb, Croatia, on November 5-6, 2012.  This workshop was the result of a signed memorandum of understanding between NCI and the Croatian Ministry of Health to promote research collaboration and information exchange in cancer prevention with Croatia and the surrounding region.  Croatia has made some progress in tobacco control, including a comprehensive tobacco advertising ban, and will be furthering its efforts by adding additional measures of control when the country joins the European Union next year.  Yet, they have had some setbacks: the 100% smokefree workplace law implemented in 2009 was later altered to exempt cafes and bars.  The workshop concluded with recommendations for future collaboration on tobacco control research and data collection.

A guide to assessing dietary intake in the context of obesity&#8221; was a <a href="http://www.internationaldietetics.org/Congress.aspx" ><span style="color:#099835">satellite meeting to the 16th International Congress of Dietetics</span></a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> held in August 2012, in Newcastle, New South Wales. The meeting was intended to enhance knowledge and skills to assess dietary intake, evaluate misreporting, and interpret findings in the context of obesity. Sharon Kirkpatrick gave a keynote presentation on <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/events/measurement-error/" title="measurement error in dietary intake data"><span style="color:#099835">measurement error in dietary intake data</span></a> and delivered a workshop on addressing and reducing measurement error. Key takeaways included learning how others are currently approaching the collection and analysis of dietary intake data, identifying gaps in knowledge that will inform our approaches to dissemination of knowledge and methods on this topic, and networking with researchers, with the potential for future collaborations.
Another satellite meeting was held in September 2012, &#8220;New Age Dietetics: How Can We Harness Technology for Practice?&#8221;  The event introduced global perspectives and explored future directions in the application of technology to dietetics and dietary assessment. Sharon Kirkpatrick gave an overview and demonstration of the NCI’s <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/" ><span style="color:#099835">Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall (ASA24)</span></a> system as an example of technological advancements in dietary assessment. ASA24 advances the field of dietary assessment by making it economically feasible to collect high-quality dietary intake data in large studies, improving our ability to understand relationships between diet and cancer and other chronic diseases. In addition to informing the Australian dietetic community about the availability of this tool and the potential to use it with different populations, takeaways included learning about other technological advancements in dietary assessment as well as the use of technology in interventions, screening, and other initiatives.

NCI joined the third issuance of the <a href="https://www.fic.nih.gov/Programs/Pages/tobacco.aspx" title="International Tobacco and Health Research and Capacity"><span style="color:#099835">International Tobacco and Health Research and Capacity</span></a> Building program, a trans-NIH research initiative led by the Fogarty International Center and co-sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The goal of this Request for Application continues to be to support research and research-capacity-building projects focused on observational, interventional, or policy research that addresses the large and growing burden of tobacco use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  As in the past, research projects must represent collaborations between scientists in the United States or other high-income country and scientists from one or more LMICs, the proposed research must be of local relevance, and research capacity strengthening must be an integral and significant part of the proposal. Projects will also be required to disseminate research findings to broad audiences, incorporate strategies for regional impact, and take steps to ensure the project's sustainability following the conclusion of the grant period. Applications were reviewed in January 2012, and eight projects were selected for funding. The projects proposed for funding include collaborations with 13 LMICs throughout diverse regions of the globe including the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, and Eastern Asia.</p>

This project will engage a combination of public and private partners to perform an mhealth/text-based smoking cessation intervention demonstration project based on a country-specific modification of the QuitNowTXT library in China.  The project will assist in determining the potential effectiveness and acceptability of a health-based short message service (SMS) messaging program within China’s large population of smokers. If effective, text-based programs would provide a low-cost means to increase public education and knowledge on the harmful effects of smoking, and also to deliver a smoking cessation intervention. Pre-trial testing and a very successful demonstration project have been completed. The two-phase randomized control trial of a cessation messaging program is expected to begin in early 2013.</p>

A project development meeting focused on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was held on December 12, 2012, in Bethesda.  The initiative is sponsored by the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cgh" title="NCI Center for Global Health"><span style="color:#099835">NCI Center for Global Health</span></a>, and the meeting brought together European leaders of the Late Effects Working Party of the <a href="http://www.ebmt.org/" title="European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)"><span style="color:#099835">European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)</span></a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> and experts from NCI, including Julia Rowland, Russ Glasgow, Sandra Mitchell, and a representative from the <a href="http://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/cGVHD/index.htm" title="Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) Consortium"><span style="color:#099835">Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) Consortium</span></a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> which receives funding and/or programmatic support from NCI (DCTD) and the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research. A key objective of the initiative is to launch an EBMT-wide (55 countries) effort focused on advancing education and training in GVHD, with a particular emphasis on cGVHD, the most prominent late effect in cancer survivors after allogeneic transplant. <br><br>

Project proposals are being developed through the EU funding mechanisms, and NCI is contributing its scientific capacities. The meeting objectives were to produce a proposal focused on two-way, long-term educational programs and consider a prospective observational study in the EBMT. The ultimate goal is to develop a mechanism that will facilitate the understanding and overcoming of great disparities in post-transplant care and research across Europe as well as advance research in this area by fostering collaborations on both sides of the Atlantic. Post-allogeneic transplant survivorship is an attractive model to study cancer survivorship due to the abundant medical and quality-of-life issues in these patients.

<p><a name="35" id="thirtyfive"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">WHO Western Pacific Intercountry Workshop for Non Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Monitoring, Seoul, Korea</span><br>
Brenda Edwards participated as a resource person at the WHO Western Pacific Intercountry Workshop for Non Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Monitoring December 3-7, 2012, in Seoul, Korea.  The National Cancer Center of Korea, which has responsibility for the Korean cancer registry, hosted the meeting and also served as members of the training faculty. The Korean Centers for Disease Control provided information and served as an exemplar and resource for the surveillance system.  The workshop for the five participating countries was structured around WHO’s approach for the initial development of country and regional action plans based on standard WHO training materials.  The workshop was organized by staff responsible for Non Communicable Disease and Health Promotion at the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific Region (WPRO - Manila, Philippines), and the WHO Headquarters in Geneva,  Four senior participants and the WHO country representatives from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Mongolia, and the Philippines received a week of training.  The WHO Non Communicable Disease surveillance framework has identified 25 indicators and nine (voluntary/tracer) global targets for diabetes, heart diseases, cancer, and chronic pulmonary disease.  The national capacity for surveillance and monitoring is limited in most of the low- and middle-income countries.  The workshop covered WHO measures and surveys for risk factors, mortality/vital systems, cancer registries, health systems, and public policies.  Ann Chao, the NCI Director for Cancer Research Programs, East Asia, from the Center for Global Health, participated in the meeting.  This facilitated establishing stronger relationships among NCI, WHO, and other leaders and agencies within these six East Asian countries.  This will be followed up with travel to some of the participant countries as well as continuation of the relationship previously established among the Korean cancer control and research communities.
