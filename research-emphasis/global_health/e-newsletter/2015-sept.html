<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Palliative Care in Kazakhstan</span><br />
In June 2015, Julia Rowland, Lynne Padgett, and colleagues  from the Division of Cancer Prevention met with a delegation of physicians from  Kazakhstan who were seeking information on how to build a national palliative  care program. Coordinated by NCI&rsquo;s Center for Global Health (CGH) staff members  Sophia Michaelson, Senior Advisor for CIS countries, and Elisabeth Dupont,  delegation members to this meeting included Dilyara Kaidarova, Correspondent  Member of the National Academy of Sciences, and Director, Almaty Oncology  Centre; Gulnara Kunirova, Executive Director, Together Against Cancer  Foundation, and President, Kazakhstan Palliative Care Association; and Dr.  Mukhtar Essenzhanovich Tuleutayev, Head of the Astana Cancer Centre. The  visitors talked about current hospice care structure and initiatives in  Kazakhstan and the key challenges to development of palliative care programs  and services nationally. NCI staff provided information about a broad range of  resources including training and educational materials, assessment tools, and  links to sources for current standards for such care to help with their planning  processes.  This visit represented the  first step of a new CGH program aiming to develop palliative care in Eastern  Europe and in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.&nbsp; It will  be followed by a special session on palliative care at the time of the cancer  leadership forum that will be organized by CGH in Tashkent in October 2015 and,  probably, by a palliative care workshop in Minsk in June 2016.</p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Caribbean Cancer Registry Hub Presentation for Chief  Medical Officers of the Caribbean region</span><br />
On June 23, 2015, Damali Martin presented plans for the development and  implementation of the Caribbean Cancer Registry Hub to a committee of chief  medical officers representing Caribbean nations. Dr. Martin provided background  on the activities leading to the current status of the hub, spoke about the  2014 Cancer Surveillance meeting and its recommendations, provided information  regarding the governance of the hub, gave a timeline of events for the hub, and  described potential benefits for the Caribbean region.&nbsp; Dr. Martin&rsquo;s  co-presenters were Glennis Andall-Brereton of the Caribbean Public Health  Agency (CARPHA) and Les Mery of the International Agency for Research on Cancer  (IARC). The Caribbean Cancer Registry Hub is a project of IARC&rsquo;s <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://gicr.iarc.fr/">Global Initiative for  Cancer Registry Development</a>.</p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">TCRB Launches  International and Global Health Activities Website </span><br />
In May 2015, the Tobacco Control Research Branch launched a website titled <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/international/index.html">DCCPS International  and Global Health Activities: About TCRB International Tobacco Control Research</a>.  The site highlights the division&rsquo;s international and global tobacco control  activities and also provides a current overview of the tobacco control  environment globally, as well as TCRB&rsquo;s role in it. Visitors can view selected  recent tobacco control-related publications and resources as well as learn more  about the branch&rsquo;s current international grant funding.  </p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">SmokefreeTXT Mexico Pilot  Begins in Veracruz State</span><br />
SmokefreeTXT,  a component of the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://smokefree.gov/">Smokefree.gov</a> Initiative, has expanded beyond its domestic text message-based smoking  cessation intervention. The SmokefreeTXT Mexico project is a study that  examines the effectiveness of adapting successful domestic mHealth programs to  other countries. Using content from SmokefreeTXT&rsquo;s Spanish message library, the  SmokefreeTXT Mexico message library was modified culturally and linguistically  to better apply to the needs of the people of Veracruz state. Considering that  in Mexico there is no institutionalized service support for smoking cessation,  and the use of mobile technologies for health is still emerging, a successful  implementation of SmokefreeTXT could prove to be a cost-effective and efficient  means of improving health outcomes in other countries facing similar health  threats.</p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Multinational Time Use  Survey – MET Score Linkage Project</span><br />
In July 2015, David Berrigan hosted a seminar by Jonathan Gershuny and Teresa Harms titled  &ldquo;Problems and opportunities in the use of diaries for a balanced view of the  sources of human energy expenditure throughout the day.&rdquo;&nbsp;Dr. Gershuny is a  professor of economic sociology in the Oxford Sociology Department and a senior  research fellow at Nuffield College UK. He is the director of the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.timeuse.org/" target="_blank">Centre for Time Use Research</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a>. Dr. Harms is a  research fellow at the center. Together they are working on a contract with NCI  for pilot work linking time use behavior categories from the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.timeuse.org/mtus/" target="_blank">Multinational Time Use Study</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a> (MTUS)) to  Metabolic Equivalence (MET) scores. The study includes more than 60 data sets  from 25 countries and spans four decades.&nbsp;Linkage of MET scores to all or  part of the MTUS could result in a valuable resource for studying international  and decadal variation in energy expenditure and its consequences. Dr. Berrigan  is the program officer for this project.<strong></strong></p>

The <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cgh/events">Latin American Cancer Control Leadership Forum</a> took place in Cancun, Mexico, September 1-3, 2015. The Forum convened teams  comprising government, civil society, private sector, and academic  representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and  Uruguay for a structured, outcomes-focused workshop. Participants learned about  important aspects of cancer control planning and work on developing, enhancing  or implementing their respective national cancer control plans. Cynthia Vinson  of the Implementation Science Team worked with others from NCI&rsquo;s Center for  Global Health to help initiate or enhance cancer control planning efforts in  order to decrease the global burden of cancer.</p>
