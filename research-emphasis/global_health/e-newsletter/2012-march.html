     <p><a href="http://www.fic.nih.gov/Programs/Pages/tobacco.aspx" style="color: #02561c;" >DCCPS Contributing to Trans-NIH Research Capacity Building Program</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a><br />
     NCI joined the recently released third issuance of the International Tobacco and Health Research and Capacity Building program, a trans-NIH research initiative led by the Fogarty International Center (FIC) and co-sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The goal of this RFA continues to be to support research and research capacity building projects focused on observational, interventional, or policy research that address the large and growing burden of tobacco use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As in the past, research projects must represent collaborations between scientists in the United States or other high-income country and scientists from one or more LMICs, the proposed research must be of local relevance, and research capacity strengthening must be an integral and significant part of the proposal. The major portion of the research must be conducted in the LMIC under study. Projects will also be required to disseminate research findings to broad audiences, incorporate strategies for regional impact, and take steps to ensure the project&#8217;s sustainability following the conclusion of the grant period.</p>
     
     <a href="http://www.itcproject.org/" style="color: #02561c;" >DCCPS Contributing to Demonstrating the Effectiveness of Tobacco Control Policies in High- vs. Low- Income Countries</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a><br />
     NCI supports the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Consortium (ITC Project). The objective of the ITC Project is to evaluate and understand the impact of the tobacco control policies implemented as part of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the first-ever global health treaty. The ITC Project began in 2002 with annual surveys of smokers in the four major English-speaking countries&#8212;US, U.K., Canada, and Australia&#8212;and has since expanded to more than 20 countries. The ITC Project is the only international study that is specifically evaluating the effectiveness of the FCTC policies, and as a result, the data from the ITC Project have quickly become an important source of scientific evidence on the impact of national-level tobacco control polices. NCI also supports the Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation in China and South Korea, also known as the ITC Asia Project, which includes a collaboration of more than 40 tobacco control experts across nine countries who are examining the psychosocial and behavioral effects of FCTC tobacco control policies in China and South Korea.

     Stephen Taplin has been working with investigators from 17 countries to estimate the variation in rates of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed through screening programs in Europe and some parts of Asia.  The countries involved are part of the International Screening Network.  Researchers are looking at variation in rates of DCIS and methods of treatment, as these factors can have an impact on screening of women around the world.</p>
    
     <p><a name="translation" id="translation"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Translation and Implementation of the Health information National Trend Survey (HINTS) in China</span><br />
     Behavioral Research Branch staff members (Kelly Blake, Wen-ying Sylvia Chou, Lila Finney-Rutten, Bradford Hesse, and Richard Moser) are collaborating with investigators at George Mason University and Renming University in China, to develop, validate, and implement Chinese translations of the Health Communication National Trend Survey (HINTS IV).  Principal investigators from Renming University have been invited to visit the NCI during their April visit to the DC area. This national survey, currently being modified for linguistic and cultural appropriateness and pilot-tested in Beijing, will contribute to the health communication surveillance, inform public health programs such as tobacco cessation and healthy lifestyle promotion efforts, and enable international research collaboration using cross-regional data.  The validated instrument will also facilitate adoption of the Chinese translation of HINTS in the US for future iterations of the survey.</p>
    
     <p><a name="descent" id="descent"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate GEM Translation Initiative</span><br />
     The Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) is currently expanding the capabilities of the Grid-Enabled Measures (GEM) database, a website containing behavioral and biological survey measures and data to facilitate scientific collaboration.  HCIRB is currently piloting language translation and workspaces that facilitate collaboration of international research consortia. The Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) group, whose primary aim is to reduce disproportionately high levels of prostate cancer in African-American men and the broader diaspora, has been invited to be the first international research team to pilot the GEM Translation Initiative (GEM-TI).  Members of the MADCaP will soon have access to a tool allowing researchers to prioritize measures and collectively translate them in a wiki platform (&#34;crowdsourcing&#34; translation).  This effort promises to accelerate research by providing a Web-based infrastructure for collaboration that transcends language, borders, and resource deficits.</p>
