Several  NCI staff, including Catherine Alfano, Laura Forsythe, Erin Kent, and Julia Rowland,  collaborated with European colleagues on papers for a special supplement to the  journal <em>Cancer </em>comparing current perspectives and emerging issues in  survivorship for researchers and clinicians on both sides of the Atlantic. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.v119.S11/issuetoc" style="color:#02561c">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ cncr.v119.S11/issuetoc</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">International  Collaboration of Consortia Links New DNA Regions to Breast, Ovarian, and  Prostate Cancers</span><br />
      In  March 2013, several scientific journals--<em>Nature Genetics</em>, <em>PLoS  Genetics</em>, <em>The American Journal of Human Genetics</em>, <em>Molecular  Genetics</em>, and <em>Nature Communications</em>--featured new research findings  from the <a href="http://www.cogseu.org/?utm_source=May+newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=MAY+2013&amp;utm_medium=archive" style="color:#02561c">Collaborative Oncological  Gene-environment Study (COGS)</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a><br />
  <br />
      The COGS international mega-collaboration includes many NCI-supported  investigators from <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/?utm_source=May+newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=MAY+2013&amp;utm_medium=archive" style="color:#02561c">EGRP-supported research  consortia</a> and from the NCI-funded <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/gameon/?utm_source=May+newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=MAY+2013&amp;utm_medium=archive" style="color:#02561c">Genetic Associations and  Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON)</a> network. It was designed to advance  scientific understanding of genetic susceptibility to three hormone-related  cancers: breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. The initiative examined  hundreds of thousands of locations in the genomes of more than 250,000 people  with and without cancer. The results represent a milestone in epidemiology;  researchers discovered many new regions linked with overall risk for breast,  ovarian, and prostate cancers, as well as confirming previously known genetic  markers.<br />
  <br />
      These results demonstrate the value of continued large-scale, international,  scientific collaborations and arrays designed for mega-analysis. A new custom  genotyping array, the &quot;OncoChip,&quot; is currently being designed by  investigators from the United Kingdom and the United States to provide further  genetic characterization of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, and lung  cancers.<br />

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Cancer and  Primary Care Research International Network (Ca-PRI) Annual Meeting, UK</span><br />
      Carrie  Klabunde and Stephen Taplin participated in the <a href="http://ca-pri.dk/" style="color:#02561c">Cancer and Primary Care Research International Network  (Ca-PRI) annual meeting</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> in Cambridge, England, on April 15-16, 2013.  Ca-PRI was established in 2008 and brings together investigators from various  parts of the world who have a common interest in primary care cancer research.  Dr. Klabunde chaired a workshop on International Collaborative Research to  Improve Cancer Screening, and gave a presentation, titled &ldquo;Colorectal Cancer  Screening Participation:  How Can It Be  Measured for Meaningful Comparisons, and How Can It Be Improved?,&rdquo; based on  work that she is leading for the NCI-sponsored <a href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/icsn/" style="color:#02561c">International  Cancer Screening Network (ICSN)</a>. Dr. Taplin presented on work that  he has been engaged in through the ICSN to make cross-national comparisons of  the classification and management of ductal carcinoma <em>in situ</em> in breast cancer screening. Drs. Klabunde and Taplin also  contributed to discussions about another international project in which they  are co-investigators with colleagues from the United Kingdom. That project is  examining the role of primary care in cancer screening delivery  internationally. The next meeting of the Ca-PRI consortium will be held in  Winnipeg, Canada, on June 10-13, 2014. </p>

      On  April 17, 2013, Stephen Taplin attended a meeting of researchers from  throughout the UK leading five initiatives to compare cancer survival curves  from different regions within the UK (England, Northern Ireland, and Wales) to  regions in Europe (Denmark, Norway, Sweden), Australia, and Canada. This is a  major effort by the UK to more closely examine their cancer care and the role  of primary care within it. The effort is born out of concern that survival is  worse in the UK compared to other countries. &nbsp;There was particular concern  that inadequate evaluation of symptomatic patients in primary care was affecting  cancer survival. Dr. Taplin attended as a primary care and cancer detection  content expert and to understand whether the effort is relevant to comparisons  within the US.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">National Trends  Survey in China (HINTS China)</span><br />
    The  Behavioral Research Program (BRP) continues to participate in the development  of the Health Information National Trends Survey in China (HINTS China).  A large-scale survey developed through a  joint venture by China&rsquo;s Renmin University and Ministry of Health of China and  George Mason University (GMU), BRP staff have been asked to provide scientific  input and support in the survey development and implementation and, most  recently, data analysis and results dissemination.   As of early 2013, pilot surveys were completed  and data gathered from two cities, Beijing and Hefei, Anhui Province.  At the DC-Area Health Communication  Conference in March 2013, the Chinese team presented preliminary results and  held extensive discussion with NCI and GMU colleagues on strategies for  communicating pilot data results and plans for a full-scale, biennial national  survey.  Following the conference, pilot  data were shared with the Behavioral Research Program, with plans for data  analyses and publications, including presentations at the HINTS Data Users Conference  in October 2013.  </p>

         <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">China Smoking  Cessation Program Using Text Messages<br />
         </span>This  project will assist in determining the potential effectiveness and  acceptability of a health-based SMS (short message service) messaging program  within China&rsquo;s large population of smokers. If effective, test-based programs  would provide a low-cost means to increase public education and knowledge on  the harmful effects of smoking, and also to deliver a smoking cessation  intervention. Data analysis is being conducted on the text message-based  cessation project completed in Suzhou, China, which included approximately  1,600 smokers. The HHS-China MOH-Nokia text message-based smoking cessation  project in China launched in April 2013. The two-arm randomized controlled  trial of a cessation messaging program recruited more than 8,000 smokers in a  single day and is progressing well. The study timeline includes 3-month  post-treatment follow-up data (mid-September 2013) and 6-month follow-up data  (December 2013).</p>

           Cindy  Vinson is working in collaboration with the Centers for Global Health to  promote implementation science through national cancer planning efforts.&nbsp;  A key initiative is the International Cancer Control Planning  Partnership.&nbsp; For the first time, key international organizations have  joined together to coordinate their efforts to support national cancer control  plan development and implementation.&nbsp; The International Cancer Control  Planning Partnership (ICCPP) (<a href="http://www.iccp-portal.org/" style="color:#02561c">http://www.iccp-portal.org/</a>), <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> formed in  November 2012, is a group of organizations whose members were already  individually working to support country cancer control planning efforts. Now,  these organizations will work together on identified priorities to maximize  their collective resources and avoid duplication of effort.&nbsp; The long-term  outcome that the ICCPP is working towards is that all countries have and are  implementing a quality cancer control plan, which is linked to a country&rsquo;s  non-communicable disease (NCD) control efforts. The ICCPP believes that  prioritizing cancer is critical to reaching the voluntary goal within the  Global Monitoring Framework on NCDs: a 25% reduction in premature mortality  from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases  by 2025.</p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Understanding  Cancer Survivorship in Latin America: The Cases of Mexico and Brazil</span><br />
           Julia  Rowland is serving as a member of the Technical Advisory Committee for this  Mexican Health Foundation-funded project being led by Felicia Knaul at  Harvard.&nbsp; The overall goal of the project is to conceptualize and develop  policy and advocacy responses to the emerging challenge and opportunity for  survivorship in Latin America. &nbsp;As a first step, the investigators will  seek to examine the definition of &ldquo;cancer survivor&rdquo; in these two populations  and the unmet needs of cancer survivors and their families posttreatment. </p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">The Breast  Health Global Initiative (BHGI)</span><br />
           Julia  Rowland continues to work with BHGI colleagues on draft guidelines  for&nbsp;components of survivorship care for countries with different levels of  economic resources.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">NCI-Ireland-Northern  Ireland Collaboration</span><br />
           Julia  Rowland served as a consultant to Irish colleagues to develop a research grant  application for the Irish Cancer Society entitled &ldquo;Patient Reported Outcomes in Cancer Survivorship: The Patient  Experience of Living Through and Beyond Cancer in Ireland.&rdquo; The group is  awaiting word of funding status.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Breast  Intergroup-North American Breast Group (BIG-NABG) Survivorship Working Group</span><br />
      This group, which includes Julia Rowland,  finalized their first Core Baseline Questionnaire in spring 2013. Designed to  systematically capture sociodemographic, medical (including height and weight,  menstrual history, and medical conditions), as well as behavioral (e.g.,  tobacco use, activity level, alcohol use) and quality-of-life status, it is hoped  that these data-capture forms will become a regular part of all clinical trials  conducted among breast cancer patients.</p>
