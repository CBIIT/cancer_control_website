<p> <strong style="color: #02561c;">Operationalizing the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) Cancer Prevention Recommendations: A Standardized Scoring System</strong></p>
<p> Jill Reedy and Marissa Shams-White recently co-authored a paper with researchers from the World Cancer Research Fund International (WCRF), the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR), and ISGlobal. The paper details how they developed a standardized scoring system to examine adherence to the 2018 WCRF/AICR&rsquo;s Cancer Prevention Recommendations. One goal of the 2018 WCRF/AICR Score is to improve researchers&rsquo; ability to compare results across studies and populations. Dr. Shams-White also published blog posts with <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2019/08/keeping-score-assessing-impact-our-cancer-prevention-recommendations">WCRF</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> and <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://blog.aicr.org/2019/08/21/keeping-score-assessing-the-impact-of-cancer-prevention-recommendations/">AICR</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> and held a <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://twitter.com/wcrfint/status/1164900112902082560">Twitter chat</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> with her collaborators to highlight the scoring system, its development, and potential applications.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Indonesia: the Expansion of JUUL from the USA</strong></p>
<p>In early July 2019, the journal <em>Tobacco Control</em> published the industry watch article &ldquo;<a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2019/07/05/tobaccocontrol-2019-054979">JUUL from the USA to Indonesia</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>: implications for expansion to LMICs,&rdquo; coauthored by Elizabeth Orlan (Gillings School of Global Public Health, UNC at Chapel Hill), Rachel Grana, and Mark Parascandola.  The authors note that &ldquo;Indonesia and other LMICs have limited capacity to monitor and regulate these novel devices that pose potential threats to public health. JUUL&rsquo;s entrance into the Indonesian market and the markets of multiple countries in Asia and Europe emphasizes the need to monitor trends in e-cigarette use around the world, in order to prevent increasing global use of these products, and further nicotine addiction.&rdquo; </p>
