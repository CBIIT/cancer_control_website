 Brenda Edwards was one of several NCI and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) participants in a scientific site visit (July 27-29, 2016) of grantee Charles Wood (University of Nebraska, Lincoln) and his research colleagues in Lusaka, Zambia. The 3-day meeting was coordinated by Vaurice Starks on behalf of the NIH Office of AIDS Research and focused on progress in international collaborations among virologists, notably the Kaposi Sarcoma HHV8 project. Dr. Wood and his team held a pre-site visit grantsmanship workshop for colleagues in Zambia and Tanzania. Visits to the cancer hospital, pediatric cancer facility, and research labs in Lusaka augmented updates and discussions regarding research projects. Brenda gave a short presentation on global cancer registry surveillance activities that stimulated considerable discussions with clinicians involved with hospital-based cancer registries and other stakeholders contributing data to the Zambia Cancer Registry. The NCI Center for Global Health provides funding through the UICC to support the national registry staff in Zambia and their work with the African Cancer Registry Network. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Collaborations in Poland and Eastern Europe on Tobacco Control</span><br>
Mark Parascandola participated as a speaker at and a co-organizer of the Tobacco Cessation Workshop for Health Professionals in Eastern Europe, which took place October 25–26, 2016, at the Marii Sklodowskiej-Curie Cancer Institute and Hospital in Warsaw, Poland. The workshop involved approximately 30 key participants from Armenia, Georgia, Serbia, Romania, Macedonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Poland. The workshop focused on tobacco cessation methods and the role of health professionals in tobacco control, as well as identifying research needs and opportunities across the region. Outcomes of the workshop include development of a tobacco control health professional network in Eastern Europe and a forthcoming summary paper to review the state of tobacco cessation capacity across the region. Additional activities planned for 2017 include a collaboration with the Polish Hospital Federation to support tobacco control programs in hospitals. These activities are part of an ongoing series of collaborations between the US and Poland focused on innovation and biomedical science. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (ITC Project)</span><br>
 The Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) continues to support the <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.itcproject.org/" title="http://www.itcproject.org/">ITC Project</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> which conducts systematic evaluation of key policies of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control at the population level in more than 28 countries and includes more than 150 tobacco control collaborators. In 2016, the ITC project produced 22 published papers (as well as one paper in press and 12 submitted manuscripts) and 32 presentations (three invited presentations, four scientific meeting presentations, one invited public lecture, four symposia, and 20 poster presentations).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Cooperative Agreement Between NCI and Genentech to Validate PRO-CTCAE Translations</span><br>
 A key accelerator of widespread implementation of <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/">Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events</a> (PRO-CTCAE&trade;) in both international and US trials is the availability of linguistically and culturally adapted outcome measures. NCI and Genentech have recently signed a cooperative agreement to develop additional language translations of PRO-CTCAE. Efforts to reach this agreement have been in progress for almost a year, and important contributors to these negotiations include Lori Minasian of the Division of Cancer Prevention, Bob Wagner of NCI&rsquo;s Technology Transfer Center, as well as colleagues at the FDA. New languages being linguistically validated include Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, French, and Chinese. Also included in the agreement are studies to establish the between-country universality of the English, Spanish, Italian, French, and German language versions for use in countries where more than one language is spoken (e.g., Swiss Italian, French Canadian). Genentech has contracted with Corporate Translations Inc. to perform the work, and NCI is collaborating closely with both organizations to provide technical expertise with respect to the linguistic validation methods for PRO-CTCAE. By early 2018, it is anticipated that PRO-CTCAE will be available in more than 20 languages, thereby supporting the global conduct of cancer clinical trials.

 Damali Martin, Brenda Edwards, and Gonçalo Forjaz planned a basic training workshop for use of <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.iacr.com.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:canreg5&amp;catid=68&amp;Itemid=445">CanReg5</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> cancer registry software for cancer registrars from the Caribbean.  This workshop was done under the IARC Caribbean Regional Cancer Registry Hub, which is part of the <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="http://gicr.iarc.fr/">Global Initiative for Cancer Registration</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> (GICR) in developing countries.  The overall goal of the workshop was to provide basic and detailed training for cancer registrars in the use of CanReg5 and to improve their skills and enhance the quality of the collected data.  The workshop was held from November 28 – 30 at NCI&rsquo;s Shady Grove Campus.  Attendees from five Caribbean countries (Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Jamaica and Bahamas) participated in the workshop. Dr. Forjaz and Ms. Beatriz Carballo, a former cancer registrar and currently a data analyst at the Córdoba Cancer Registry, Argentina, served as faculty for the workshop.  Drs. Edwards and Martin also presented on topics that covered Global Cancer Registry-Center Surveillance and Descriptive Epidemiology, respectively. Towards the end of the workshop, the group planned future activities, including participation in the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) annual conference.</p><p align="right"><a href="#top" style="font-size:12px; color: #02561c;">Back to top</a> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) Meeting</span><br>
 Paul Jacobsen, Ashley Wilder Smith, Julia Rowland, and Mark Parascandola attended the <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.worldcancercongress.org/" title="http://www.worldcancercongress.org/">UICC World Cancer Congress</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> Meeting in Paris, France, October 31 - November 3, 2016. The conference is acknowledged by the global cancer community as the leading international event for cancer organizations. Dr. Jacobsen was a symposium presenter for a panel on integrating the psychosocial domain into cancer care and presented his paper &ldquo;Promoting Psycho-Oncology for Patient Well-Being: International Challenges and Opportunities.&rdquo; He also met with met with key leaders in the field to discuss their research and policy activities. Dr. Smith participated in a symposium examining cross-country comparisons in cancer care for adolescents and young adults (AYA). Data were presented from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States. Dr. Smith gave an oral presentation titled, &ldquo;Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Cancer Care and Outcomes: Findings from the AYA HOPE Study.&rdquo; Future collaboration with the scientists in the panel are being planned, including an effort to conduct future combined analyses with international health services and epidemiologic data on adolescents and young adults with cancer. Dr. Rowland was one of five speakers in a special session held on cancer survivorship. Attention was focused, in particular, on how best to translate the experience of delivering survivorship care in the more highly resourced nations for application in low- and middle-income nations that may be experiencing for the first time a growth in the number of their citizens who survive long-term after cancer. The challenge of equity, a theme that ran across the congress, in the face of limited resources was used to generate creative, out-of-the-box solutions with the potential to leverage people and programs already established in some countries. The importance of having key—and well-positioned---champions to propel change was another theme that cross-cut the congress. Dr. Parascandola participated along with other NCI staff as a faculty member in the NCI Implementation Science Master Course before the conference and also participated in a workshop co-sponsored by Cancer Research UK, the American Cancer Society, and NCI to develop research on the economics of tobacco control in low- and middle- income countries. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">PROMIS Health Organization (PHO) Meeting</span><br>
 Sandra Mitchell attended the PROMIS Health Organization International meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, October 23-24, 2016, which was held in tandem with the International Society of Quality of Life (ISOQOL) meeting.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">International Society of Quality of Life Meeting</span><br>
 Sandra Mitchell attended the annual research meeting of the International Society of Quality of Life (ISOQOL) in Copenhagen, Denmark, October 19-22, 2016.  She and the team who have been testing and implementing the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/">Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE&trade;)</a> delivered a symposium, and a number of PRO-CTCAE adopters presented posters reporting their work. Dr. Mitchell also met with PRO-CTCAE collaborators who are implementing PRO-CTCAE in cancer clinical trials and routine practice, including adopters in the United Kingdom, representatives from the Danish Cancer Society who are implementing PRO-CTCAE within the AmbuFlex electronic data capture system, and teams from Germany, Japan, and Sweden who are engaged in testing PRO-CTCAE in various study contexts. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">International Psycho Oncology Society (IPOS) Congress</span><br>
 Paul Jacobsen and Julia Rowland attended the <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="http://ipos2016.net/">International Psycho Oncology Society (IPOS) World Congress</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> in Dublin, Ireland, October 17-21, 2016. At the conference, Dr. Jacobsen participated in 2 days of meetings with the IPOS Board as a non-voting invited director. He also served as a discussant on two symposia, &ldquo;Growing and Developing Psychosocial Oncology Programs Worldwide: Challenges and Opportunities&rdquo; and &ldquo;Severe Fatigue in Cancer Survivors,&rdquo; and presented a paper on &ldquo;Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Targeted Cancer Therapy-related Fatigue.&rdquo; Dr. Rowland served as one of four speakers at a session on informal cancer caregiving. She compared findings from 2005 data on caregiver health and function drawn from CanCORS with that from the Caregiving in the US 2015 survey conducted by the National Alliance for Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)&rsquo;s Public Policy Institute. Findings from this and other talks in the session highlighted the continuing lack of attention to the complex needs of family members and others who serve in these critical caregiving roles, often with little acknowledgement, training or support. Data globally suggest their numbers will only increase in the decades to come, due to the growing population of survivors secondary to greater uptake of cancer control initiatives, and the aging of the worlds&rsquo; population. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Center (VCCC) Survivorship Conference and The Victorian Psycho-Oncology Research Conference</span><br>
 Dr. Rowland was the keynote speaker at the newly opened (August 2016) VCCC&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.victorianccc.org.au/events/the-inaugural-vccc-survivorship-conference-and-the-victorian-psycho-oncology-research-conference">Inaugural Cancer Survivorship Conference</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> held October 13, 2016, in Melbourne, Australia. The meeting, which brought 350 clinicians, researchers, administrators, and advocates to the center, was an opportunity to raise awareness about the long-term needs of survivors and their families and also bring attention to the &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; survivorship program now supported by the VCCC in an effort to reach Australia&rsquo;s broadly dispersed population. It is of note that the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia (COSA) recently <a target="_blank" style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.cosa.org.au/publications/launch-of-the-cosa-model-of-survivorship-care.aspx">launched a model for survivors&rsquo; care</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> that espouses a needs-based triage system designed for delivery across Australia&rsquo;s single-payer platform. Dr. Rowland was also a featured speaker at the 4th Victorian Psycho-Oncology Research Conference, held October 14 at the VCCC. Here she reviewed the progress made---and challenges that remain---in meeting the recommendations set out in the Institute of Medicine report <em>Cancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs.</em></p>

 In September, Sarah Kobrin attended three different meetings in London. First, she met with members of the Health Behaviour Research Center at University College London, where she gave a talk on using health behavior theory in intervention research and also discussed how we fund health behavior research in the US. She also met with the staff of the UK Population Sciences Working Group, of which she is the only non-UK member. Finally, she met with staff at Cancer Research UK to talk about her work on the US data from the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (ABC) Survey, which was first funded in the UK as well as five other countries. Kate Rendle, who led the analyses of the US data, participated by phone, and Sammy Quiafe, who is the primary UK collaborator on this project, presented preliminary analyses of differences between US and UK attitudes and beliefs about specific cancers, signs and symptoms of those cancers, and possible barriers to seeking help for those symptoms.</p><p align="right"><a href="#top" style="font-size:12px; color: #02561c;">Back to top</a> </p>
