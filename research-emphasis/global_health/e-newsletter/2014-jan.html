      Damali Martin completed a detail assignment to  the Pan American Health Organization in September 2013.  During that time, she performed an analysis  of infrastructure to support cervical cancer prevention and control in the  non-Latin Caribbean Islands.  The overall  goal of the analysis was to understand current programs, capacities, resources,  and needs for cervical cancer prevention and control in the non-Latin  Caribbean. The  specific aims of the report were to create an overview of the current policies,  programs, and services in place for cervical cancer prevention and control; to  synthesize individual country information that would enable better planning and  use of resources for organized national cervical cancer programs; and to provide  stakeholders with information on the state of cervical cancer programs in the  non-Latin Caribbean region and needs for technical support.   For more information and to link to the  report, please visit <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=1866&amp;Itemid=3904&amp;lang=en">here</a>. <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>  You may also access the report here: <br />

      Mirjana Djordjevic and  Mark Parascandola participated in the 7th meeting of the WHO Study  Group on Tobacco Product Regulation (TobReg) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,  December 4-6, 2013. All TobReg efforts are aimed at advising WHO about  scientifically sound recommendations to Member States that ratified the  Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), addressing the most effective  and evidence-based means to achieve a coordinated regulatory framework for  tobacco products (FCTC Articles 9 and 10). The Rio meeting was focused on  addressing specific requests of the FCTC COP5 (Conference of the Parties)  regarding  a) evaluation of new tobacco  products and other modified risk products, b) nicotine reduction and  addictiveness, c) regulation of reduced ignition propensity cigarettes, d)  establishment of a comprehensive list of toxicants and carcinogens for  reporting and regulation, e) regulation of electronic nicotine delivery systems  (ends), f) regulation of smokeless tobacco, g) an updated tobacco flavors  report; and h) an ammonia rebuttal paper. The goal was to develop research and  policy recommendations and craft documents that will be presented at the 6th  session of the COP in October 2014. The outcomes of the 7th TobReg  meeting are of great importance to inform the NIH research on tobacco products  funded in collaboration with the FDA Center for Tobacco Products. </p>

           <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">China Smoking Cessation Program using Text Messages:</span></strong> In  collaboration with Emory University, the Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB)  completed a text-based cessation program in Suzhou, China. The project included  approximately 600 smokers who received the text program and approximately 600  who did not during an annual cessation contest run by the city. Preliminary  data analysis reveals a statistically significant higher cessation rate among  those who received the text-based intervention. Further analyses are underway. In  addition, Emory University and TCRB are collaborating on a text-based program  designed to reduce second hand smoke exposure in pregnant women and infants in  China. Emory&rsquo;s research team is meeting with Chinese Public Health officials in  early December 2013 to lay the groundwork for this project.<br />
           <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">Caribbean Smoking Cessation Program using Text Messages:</span> </strong>Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB)  completed a successful small pilot project in collaboration with the Healthy  Caribbean Coalition. The results indicated strong interest in such a program  and that text-based cessation may be a useful treatment approach in the  Caribbean islands. Plans to expand the program are being discussed among the  partners.<br />

           Miho Tanaka is a member of the Asian-Pacific Shared Decision  Making Research Group. She collaborates with shared decision making researchers  in the US, Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Malaysia to conduct a  multi-country cross-sectional survey about cultural effects on patients'  preferred participation in medical decision making.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Breast  Inter-Group and North American Breast Cancer Group</span><br />
Julia Rowland, with input from Stephanie Land, worked  with members of the Breast Inter-Group and North American Breast Cancer Group  (BIG-NABCG) Survivorship Working Group to finalize a core patient questionnaire  on host factors (including demographics, working status, alcohol history,  tobacco history, height and weight, physical activity, menopausal  status/menstrual history, medical conditions, and quality of life). This  questionnaire will be added to new clinical trials fielded in the next year.</p>

        Michael Sanchez represented NCI at the  Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Grant Writing and Scientific Review Workshop hosted  by NCI&rsquo;s Center for Global health, in collaboration with the South African  Medical Research Council (SAMRC).  The  workshop was held November 18-20, 2013, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The goal  of this workshop is to encourage Sub-Saharan African investigators to address  public health issues through research. &nbsp;Workshop topics included tools and  tips for use in writing grant applications, who&rsquo;s who at funding agencies, the  peer review process, research and training funding opportunities for  Sub-Saharan African scientists at NIH and other organizations, and management of  grants at the recipient institutions in Africa.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;"><em>KNOW HEALTH</em></span><br />
        On November 12-14, 2013,  Health Communication and Informatics Research  Branch (HCIRB)  Chief Brad Hesse and HCIRB Training Fellow Kasia Galica  participated in an international public health conference in Wrocław, Poland,  called <em>KNOW HEALTH</em>. The annual <em>KNOW HEALTH</em> forum was organized by  the <em>Forum Medicum Association</em> and <em>Data Techno Park</em> in Wrocław and  was sponsored by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland, Wroclaw  Medical University, and the Governor of Lower Silesia.&nbsp; The forum was  created to be an experience-exchange and development platform for local  governments in Poland, non-profit organizations, health education and promotion  organizations, and private companies in the newly emerging medical  marketplace.&nbsp; There were two themes to the 2013 conference: one was on  cancer prevention and control, and the other was on the use of information and  communication technologies.&nbsp; HCIRB was approached because of its unique  relevance at the intersection of the two themes.&nbsp; Travel was sponsored by  the organizers, and talks were given both at the conference venue and to  students at the University of&nbsp;Wrocław Medical School.</p>

        The Big Data and Theory  Advancement Workshop was held at NIH on September 19-20, 2013, and was  sponsored by the Science of  Research and Technology Branch. The meeting brought together experts in big data analytics, systems science, and theory development  and testing to address how to leverage big data and dynamical systems models to  advance health behavior theory in the context of modifying cancer and other  disease risk factors. The meeting included a summary of the 2012 European Union  meeting in Brussels on &ldquo;New Computationally-enabled Theoretical Models to  Support Health Behavior Change and Maintenance.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
