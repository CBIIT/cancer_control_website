<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Cancer Control Research Priorities in Low- and Middle-Income Countries</strong><br>
 Irene Prabhu Das completed a 6-month detail with NCI&rsquo;s Center for Global Health in February 2018. Dr. Prabhu Das designed and conducted an in-depth analysis of research priorities reported in national cancer control plans of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Research that generates contextually applicable evidence is vital to accomplishing plan objectives as well as sustaining the resulting effects of cancer control strategies implemented to reduce the burden of cancer on LMIC populations. The aims of the analysis were to 1) ascertain LMICs&rsquo; approach to integrating research into their cancer control strategy; 2) identify the breadth and scope of cancer control research priorities in LMICs&rsquo; national strategy; and 3) explore how LMIC priorities might present opportunities for mutually beneficial research collaborations with the US and other countries, and inform research infrastructure development. This is the first analysis examining LMIC research priorities that may accelerate cancer control efforts at the local level. The analysis revealed a broad range of research-related priorities across the cancer continuum, reflecting several types of research. A paper is being finalized for publication. Please contact <a style="color:#02561c" href="mailto:prabhudasi@mail.nih.gov">Irene Prabhu Das</a> for more information on the analysis.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">PRO-CTCAE Translated and Linguistically Validated in 15 Languages Supporting the International Conduct of Cancer Clinical Trials</strong><br>
 A key accelerator of widespread implementation of <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/overview.html">Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)</a> in both international and US trials is the availability of linguistically and culturally adapted outcome measures. Supported by Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) between NCI and Genentech, and NCI and Bristol Myers Squibb, PRO-CTCAE has now been linguistically validated in <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/instrument.html">11 new languages</a>, specifically Czech, Dutch, Russian, Hungarian, Polish, Greek, Canadian French, European French, Traditional Chinese, Spanish, and German. </p>
<p>All 124 items in the PRO-CTCAE item library were translated and linguistically validated using ISPOR best practices, including cognitive interviewing to determine if the translations captured the concepts of the original PRO-CTCAE, and to evaluate comprehension, clarity, and ease of judgement. Cognitive interview probes addressed the 78 PRO-CTCAE symptom terms (e.g., fatigue), attributes (e.g., severity), response choices, and phrasing of &lsquo;at its worst&rsquo;. Items that met the a priori threshold of ≥20% of respondents with comprehension difficulties were considered for rephrasing. Interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of native speakers (pooled sample n=521; 50% female; mean age 53 years, range 18-89) recruited in 13 countries. All had received cancer-directed treatment within the past 6 months for a solid (n=426) or hematologic malignancy (n=75). The sample was enriched for older adults (23%), lower educational attainment (22%), and poor performance status (53%). </p>
<p> Across languages the median comprehension rate for the 78 symptom terms was 100% (range 82% to 100%).  PRO-CTCAE symptom terms with the lowest comprehension rates were &lsquo;cracking at the corners of the mouth&rsquo; (82%), hand-foot syndrome (84%), painful urination (85%), wheezing (85%), and stretch marks (90%). Across languages, the attributes and response choices were generally well understood and acceptable to most respondents. 25% of Polish-speaking respondents noted some judgement difficulties when distinguishing two response options for interference (a little bit/somewhat), although the phrasing was comprehensible and no acceptable alternative was identified. The phrasing for &lsquo;severity at its worst&rsquo; was well understood in 10 of 11 languages; however, 42% of Russian speakers indicated that judgements about &lsquo;severity at its worst&rsquo; were challenging to make due to cumbersome phrasing. Revised phrasing was retested with additional Russian speakers (n=22) with 100% comprehension and ease of judgement.</p>
<p>Overall, these study results demonstrate that these 11 new language versions of the PRO-CTCAE item library are conceptually, semantically, and culturally equivalent to the original English version. Study results also support harmonization of the German and Spanish language PRO-CTCAE item libraries across countries.
