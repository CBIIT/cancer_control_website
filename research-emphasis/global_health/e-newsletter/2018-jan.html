  For the fourth year, Cynthia Vinson and Brenda Edwards  served on the peer-review team of global investigators to recommend 2018  recipients for the International Innovation Grants awards sponsored by the Conquer  Cancer Foundation of the American  Society of Clinical Oncology. From a  pool of 71 interested applicants, 66 were selected to submit five-page  descriptions of their proposed research, and 28 applications were rated and  selected to submit full applications; the eight highest rated projects were  discussed via a conference call in late 2017, from which three awards of $20K  each will be made in early 2018.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">HINTS-China  Research Program</strong><br />
Bradford Hesse, Sylvia Chou, Emily Peterson, and Rick  Moser will attend a research planning meeting and formal ceremony at George  Mason University in Washington, DC, on January 25, 2018. The meeting will  celebrate and help launch the expanded Health Information National Trends  Survey (HINTS)-China research program, for which NCI staff have been providing  scientific and technical support. The HINTS-China research program recently  secured supplementary funding from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration and  added Jinan University as a research partner, which will allow data collection  to be expanded into several other regions of China and will enable the survey  to be administered in Cantonese, in addition to Mandarin.  </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">NCI-China National  Cancer Center Research Collaborations</strong><br />
  Mark Parascandola is working with colleagues at the  National Cancer Center and Peking University Medical College in Beijing, China,  on analyses of data on cigarette smoking and lung cancer in China. The group  has completed an analysis estimating the total burden of tobacco-caused cancer  mortality in China. While previous estimates have been published at the  national level, this is the first analysis to include cancer mortality and  smoking prevalence data at the provincial level, allowing for estimation of  variation across provinces in China. A paper has been completed and will be  submitted for publication. Dr. Parascandola is also working with colleagues to  conduct analyses of the economic cost of tobacco-caused cancer in China and to  look at changes in relative risks associated with cigarette smoking in China  over time.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Cancer Research UK  Visit</strong><br />
  A delegation from the Behavioral Research Program (BRP) –  consisting of Bill Klein, Linda Nebeling, Susan Czajkowski, Mark Parascandola,  Kara Hall, and Kara Wiseman – met with colleagues from Cancer Research UK  (CRUK) in London, England, on December 4-6, 2017. The delegation presented at  CRUK&rsquo;s International Advisory Board meeting and CRUK&rsquo;s staff meeting on NCI&rsquo;s  behavioral research programs and priorities, and they learned about CRUK&rsquo;s  cancer prevention activities and future cancer prevention and population health  efforts. In addition, BRP staff attended an Alcohol Health Alliance UK meeting  that included information about policies designed to reduce alcohol consumption  and a presentation by David Jernigan that highlighted industry efforts to  market alcoholic beverages to youth. Throughout the visit, the BRP team  participated in discussions of common interests in tobacco, obesity, and  alcohol research, learned about CRUK&rsquo;s innovative funding mechanisms, and  discussed plans for an NCI-CRUK &ldquo;sandpit&rdquo; workshop, expected to take place in  late 2018 or early 2019. </p>
<p>NCI Cancer Prevention Fellow Kara Wiseman is completing a  two-month detail with CRUK, the first participant in a pilot NCI-CRUK fellow  research exchange program. During her fellowship at CRUK, Dr. Wiseman  participated in several projects including analyses of data on UK physician  attitudes about obesity and alcohol. The BRP team met with Sam Smith, a  CRUK-funded researcher who will begin a one-month fellowship at NCI in March  2018. Dr. Smith&rsquo;s interests include factors associated with initiation of  chemopreventive regimens in women at high risk for breast cancer. Overall, the  NCI visit to CRUK was highly productive, resulting in identification of several  areas of mutual interest and potential collaborations that NCI and CRUK staff  will explore in the coming months. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">UK Population  Sciences Advisory Committee Meeting</strong><br />
  Sarah Kobrin from the Healthcare Delivery Research  Program traveled to London, England, in the fall of 2017 to participate in a  meeting of the UK Population Sciences Advisory Committee, for which she is the  only member from outside the UK. Key areas of discussion included data sharing  – an area where the UK is more advanced than the US – and implementation science  – an area where the US is well ahead of the UK. Dr. Kobrin&rsquo;s continued work  with this group affords the opportunity for US advances to be considered more quickly  in the UK, where they have single payer health care and much less government  funding of research. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">International  Conference on Waterpipe Tobacco Smoking Research</strong><br />
