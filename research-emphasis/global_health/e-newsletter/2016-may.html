<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Webinar Highlights from CISNET&rsquo;s  International Work</span><br />
A  February 1 webinar hosted by the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cgh">NCI Center for Global Health</a> featured international  components of NCI&rsquo;s <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://cisnet.cancer.gov">Cancer Intervention and  Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)</a>. CISNET is a collaborative consortium (U01) of  modelers in breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, esophagus, and cervical cancers,  using surveillance data and simulation modeling to improve understanding of the  impact of cancer control interventions on incidence and mortality. </p>
<p>Eric  (Rocky) Feuer, Overall NCI Project Scientist for CISNET, gave an overview of  the initiative and its support for international cancer control planning. CISNET<strong> </strong>investigators then shared global  activities that are underway within four CISNET cancer site groups. Chin Hur  (Massachusetts General Hospital) discussed the use of modeling to compare the  cost-effectiveness of high-resolution microendoscopy vs. standard endoscopy for  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) screening in China. Rafael Meza (University  of Michigan) described modeling lung cancer in Mexico and Thailand, where  CISNET funding is supporting the adaptation of smoking models to estimate the  impact of tobacco control policies and screening on the lung cancer burden in  those two middle-income countries. Jane Kim (Harvard School of Public Health)  spoke about efforts to optimize cervical cancer screening in HIV- positive  women in three countries with a high burden of both:  Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. Ruth Etzioni  (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) described the CISNET prostate group&rsquo;s  efforts to modify models to evaluate cancer control programs in non-US  populations and collaborate with investigators in the United Kingdom and the  Bahamas to develop policies for their populations and resources. CISNET  modelers are using individualized screening, biopsy, diagnosis, and treatment  data to recalibrate models of prostate cancer&rsquo;s natural history, and subsequent  work will include using the recalibrated models to project long-term outcomes  and harm-benefit trade-offs for various screening and treatment policies. <strong></strong></p>

Mirjana Djordjevic attended the 8th WHO TobReg meeting, as a Temporary  Adviser to WHO, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, December 9-11, 2015. The goal of the  meeting was to develop recommendations on several topics to aid the  implementation of Articles 9 and 10 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco  Control (FCTC) in member countries (180 Parties to the Convention). The 6th  Conference of the Parties (COP6) at the meeting in Moscow, Russia, in 2014,  charged the WHO Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI) to facilitate review of the state  of the science on 10 distinct&nbsp;topics as pertains to tobacco product  regulation and develop science-based recommendations&nbsp; to inform policy,  regulation, and research in member countries. WHO/TFI and TobReg members  identified experts to write 10 background papers to inform discussions and  deliberations on menthol in tobacco products; waterpipe toxicants and missions;  applicability and adaptability of WHO TobLabNet methods (SOPs) for cigarette  testing to waterpipe tobacco smoking; specific  cigarette characteristics and design features; toxicants in smokeless tobacco  products (STP); applicability and adaptability of WHO TobLabNet Methods (SOPs)  for testing nicotine, TSNA, and BaP in cigarette tobacco and smoke to other  tobacco products including STP; electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)  toxicants: e-liquids and aerosols; applicability and adaptability of the WHO  TobLabNet Methods (SOPs) to ENDS; and exposure to aerosol from smoking-proxy  electronic inhaling systems.</p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">3rd International Conference on UV and Skin Cancer Prevention</span><br />
  As a member of the  planning team with Cancer Council Victoria and US CDC, Anne Hartman co-chaired,  gave oral presentations, and moderated discussion at the pre-conference  Workshop on surveillance, methodology, and research related to assessment  of&nbsp;skin cancer risk factors on December 8, 2015. This workshop was part of  the International Conference on UV and Skin Cancer Prevention that took place  in Melbourne, Australia, December 7-11, 2015. The Workshop covered surveillance  of skin cancer risk factors, including methods used and lessons learned from  various countries. Policy analysis and surveillance methods used to measure sun  protection and indoor tanning policies were discussed. Participants discussed methods  for improving existing measures and creating new ones in the context of new  technologies and new survey methods. Participants had an opportunity to explore  how to collect common behavioral measures across countries and initiate  collaborations to facilitate skin cancer prevention research. During the main  conference sessions on December 9-11, Dr. Hartman actively participated in  discussion of relevant behavioral, policy, and communication interventions with  her international colleagues. The venue was particularly relevant, as the  Australians are models for the US and the rest of the world in skin cancer  prevention, as well as tobacco control.</p>
<p>Frank Perna and Dr. Hartman  are exploring ways that DCCPS can help co-sponsor/support the next conference,  proposed to be held here in the US in late 2017.&nbsp; Dr. Perna and Alan  Geller of Harvard have led a team to review and evaluate both published  literature and our division&rsquo;s research portfolio to identify research and  knowledge gaps in this area and promote research opportunities in the future to  fill these gaps.&nbsp; Drs. Perna and Geller and some others presented on this  work at a symposium at the Society of Behavioral Medicine in April 2016. </p>
