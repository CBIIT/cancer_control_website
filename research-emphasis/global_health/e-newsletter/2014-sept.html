<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Hong Kong Meeting  Spotlights Geospatial Health Research</span><br />
  David  Berrigan presented a keynote address at the <a style="color:#02561c" href="http://www.iseis.cuhk.edu.hk/fighrc/Introduction.html">High Level Forum on  Fostering International Geospatial Health Research Collaborations: Challenges  and Opportunities</a>, <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>  held June 16-18, 2014, in Hong Kong, China. His keynote, &ldquo;Geospatial and  Contextual Approaches to Energy Balance and Health,&rdquo; discussed research  activities focused on environmental factors that influence physical activity,  diet, and obesity that are being conducted by DCCPS scientists and grantees.  Additionally, Dr. Berrigan chaired a session concerning space, spatial  targeting, and health and spoke during the panel session &ldquo;Building an  International Research Network:&nbsp; Research Agenda and Policy.&rdquo; The meeting  was attended by researchers from Europe, China, and the US. Major foci included  air pollution, avian flu, and spatial correlates of health behaviors and health  services.&nbsp;Air pollution is a known carcinogen. Short papers by Dr.  Berrigan and other presenters are forthcoming.&nbsp;Additional meetings are  planned in Chicago and Utrecht in 2015.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The  forum highlighted four aspects of spatial research on health that cut across  national borders:&nbsp; 1) Disease knows no boundaries. Several discussions  focused on relationships between avian flu outbreaks and transnational bird  migration routes. 2) Air and water pollutants move across borders. Attention  was focused on the urgent need to share new analytical and modeling techniques  to help formulate rational approaches to air pollution in multiple countries. 3) There was great  interest in the potential for transnational comparisons of relationships,  especially causal relationships, between the built environment  and cancer-related health behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity). The absence of  within-country variation in the built environment can pose challenges for  studying such associations in one country at a time. 4) Meeting attendees  discussed the potential need to coordinate individual-level, spatially located  health and behavioral data, especially detailed data being collected on  physical activity, social context, and, increasingly, biological parameters  such as heart rate. Such crowd-sourced data could be of great utility for both  research and policy setting.</p>

In May 2014, the Sensor Methods Collaboratory  was launched, bringing together nearly 100 researchers who are interested in  accelerometer-based physical activity measures. Entirely web-based using  Basecamp, the Collaboratory provides a vehicle for communication across a  diverse range of areas required to facilitate discussion and sharing of data and  research/analytic methods. The project will also facilitate the generation of richly  characterized data sets for use in developing or benchmarking analytic methods.  Participants will be able to discuss needs, develop shared resources, propose  standard protocols and metadata requirements, pilot new tools, and disseminate  methodological research for further evaluation or implementation. Five working groups  have been established, each with US and overseas co-leads. Richard Troiano and  James McClain are the NCI leads for the Sensor Methods Collaboratory.  An <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782483">overview paper</a> describing the  Collaboratory was published in July 2014 inthe <em>British Journal of Sports  Medicine</em>.</p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">ASA24-Canada  Diet Assessment Tool Available Soon</span><br />
The NCI <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/">Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall (ASA24™)</a> has been used in a  range of research studies to collect almost 200,000 dietary recalls since the  release of a Beta version in 2009. A Canadian adaptation (ASA24-Canada), led by  the Food Directorate at Health Canada in collaboration with NCI, makes use of  the program&rsquo;s interface, with modifications reflecting the Canadian food  supply. Many changes reflect differences in terminology, brand name and fast  food restaurant items between the two countries. ASA24-Canada will be freely  available to researchers soon via the <a style="color:#02561c" href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/">NCI ASA24 website</a>. Work is underway to incorporate Canadian  nutrient data into the ASA24 analytic modules for computing energy and nutrient  intakes from foods and beverages reported on ASA24 recalls. The adaptation of  ASA24 for use in different contexts is a promising step toward enhancing the  comparability of nutrition research conducted across countries, helping to  advance our understanding of how diet influences cancer.</p>

Erik  Augustson and Heather Patrick traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa, with  support from NCI&rsquo;s Center for Global Health (CGH), to further the development  of mHealth cessation projects. They met with US Embassy and South Africa  Ministry of Health staff. The primary collaborator within South Africa is  Vitality/Discovery Health, an international wellness company. Three projects  have been identified to move forward in the next few months. The first is pilot  project of the NCI SmokefreeTXT and HealthyYouTXT programs within an existing  worksite wellness program. The second is an expansion of this pilot to a  larger-scale randomized control trial (RCT) in support of broader efforts to  deliver interventions for health behaviors that are risk factors for  non-communicable diseases within worksites. The final project will focus on the  integration of mHealth resources into existing clinical settings to improve  continuity of care and delivery of behavioral intervention focused on maternal  and child health. Potential target behaviors include smoking cessation,  reduction of secondhand smoke exposure, diet, physical activity, and engagement  in prenatal care.</p>
