  BRP Associate Director, Bill Klein, served as the Director  for an innovation sandpit workshop focused on cancer-related decision making  and health behavior hosted by <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/" target="_blank" style="color:#02561c">Cancer  Research United Kingdom</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> (CRUK).  Seven of the ten participating teams were awarded seed grants at the end of the  3-day workshop to conduct pilot and feasibility work. Lucy Davies from  CRUK also served as a consultant for a similar sandpit workshop hosted by NCI  in May. There are currently plans to organize a joint NCI-CRUK sandpit workshop  in 2017.  Additionally, CRUK&rsquo;s Jyotsna  Vohra and Linda Bauld visited BRP in April to discuss their work, particularly  in regard to using research to inform policy. BRP will be sending a  contingent to visit CRUK in 2017.</p>
<p><span  style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">International  Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (ABC) Survey: Analytic Session with UCL Collaborator</span><br>
In April 2016, Samantha Quaife from the University of  College London visited NCI for a week-long analytic session with the primary  aims of a) creating a merged dataset linking ABC survey data collected in the  United States with data collected in the United Kingdom (England, Wales, and  Northern Ireland), and b) conducting preliminary analyses. Kate Rendle with  Sarah Kobrin and Genevieve Grimes in HDRP led the session, but Ms. Quaife also  met with collaborators across DCCPS, including Bill Klein and Erin Ellis in  BRP, Pam Marcus in EGRP, and several others. The ABC survey data provide a  novel resource for international comparison of population awareness and beliefs  about cancer. The survey was first administered in six countries (Australia,  Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the UK) by the International Cancer  Benchmark Partnership (ICBP), part of Cancer Research UK.  Dr. Kobrin, working with the late Jane  Wardle, led the data collection in the US. A number of analyses comparing  barriers to care and cancer beliefs in the UK and the US are in progress.  Additionally, in September 2016, Sarah will meet with ICBP collaborators in  London to further discuss current and planned projects. </p><p align="right"><a href="#top" style="font-size:12px; color: #02561c;">Back to top</a> </p>

  Veronica Chollette, Sallie Weaver, Eduardo Salas, and Mary  Lou Smith convened a Panel session to discuss the NCI and American Society of  Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Teams in Cancer Care Delivery Project: Implications  for Team Research and Cancer Care Delivery on July 15, 2016, at the 2016  INGRoup Annual Conference in Helsinki, Finland. The goal of the session  was to help conference participants understand the complexities of cancer care  delivery, the impetus towards improving coordination of care through effective  health care teams, and how the science of team research can improve cancer care  delivery and patient outcomes. Perspectives on the cross-disciplinary  collaboration was shared by each panelist, and they examined team  interdependence in cancer care delivery through a transdisciplinary clinical  case analysis. Themes and implications for team science and practice were  discussed. The panel session cultivated the new relationships with team  researchers who traditionally study teams in non-health care sectors. The  session was well received and spurred meaningful discussion and connections.</p>
