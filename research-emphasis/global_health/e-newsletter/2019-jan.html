 The Evidence to Support Prevention Implementation and Translation (ESPRIT) Research Group hosted Cynthia Vinson and other experts for a <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/esprit/events/">day-long seminar on November 28, 2018</a> <a href ="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>, at University College Cork, Ireland. The purpose of the seminar was to encourage researchers, health professionals, and policy makers to explore implementation questions within their own field of research or health care setting. With a focus on implementation strategies and research methods, the seminar offered practical advice to participants trying to study or implement interventions. It also was an opportunity for researchers, health practitioners, and policy makers to share their knowledge and capacity to enhance implementation research in Ireland. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Scientific Conference of the International Association of Cancer Registries </strong><br>
 Several plenary presentations were given by DCCPS staff at <a style="color: #02561c;" href="http://www.iacr.com.fr/">the 2018 Scientific Conference of the International Association of Cancer Registries</a> <a href ="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> (IACR) held in Arequipa, Peru, on November 12-15, 2019. Angela Mariotto spoke on &ldquo;Using modeling and cancer registry survival data to estimate recurrence burden,&rdquo; Gonçalo Forjaz de Lacerda presented &ldquo;Lung cancer attributable to tobacco consumption in Portugal in 2015,&rdquo; and two talks were given on collaborative work in the Caribbean: &ldquo;Supporting the improvement of data availability for cancer control and prevention in the Caribbean (Sarah Crooks, Trinidad and Tobago) and &ldquo;Standardizing cancer registration in the Caribbean through the IARC Regional Hub&rdquo; (Betsy Kohler, NAACCR).  A pre-conference workshop on Quality of Cancer Registries, organized by the IACR GICR (Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development) international experts Marion Piñeros and Esther de Vries, had over 25 participants, including Brenda Edwards.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">International Congress of Behavioral Medicine (IBCM)</strong><br>
 Susan Czajkowski chaired and presented in a pre-conference workshop on November 14, 2018, at the <a style="color: #02561c;" href="http://www.icbm2018.cl/index.php/en/">15th International Congress of Behavioral Medicine (ICBM)</a> <a href ="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> in Santiago, Chile. In addition to Dr. Czajkowski, the session, titled &ldquo;Designing Innovative Behavioral Interventions for Chronic Diseases: The &lsquo;Nuts and Bolts&rsquo; of Behavioral Treatment Development,&rdquo; included talks by Sylvie Naar from Florida State University, Lynda Powell from Rush University in Chicago, and Ken Freedland from Washington University in St. Louis. Participants heard an overview of the Obesity Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for designing and testing behavioral treatments for chronic diseases; learned about appropriate study designs and methods for developing behavioral treatments; and applied the ORBIT model to their own projects. The model was developed through the ORBIT consortium, a cooperative agreement program supporting seven research sites across the US with the goal of translating findings from basic research on human behavior into more effective interventions to alter obesity-related health behaviors. During the ICBM meeting, Dr. Czajkowski and Dr. Freedland also led a midday session on the International Behavioural Trials Network (<a style="color: #02561c;" href="http://www.ibtnetwork.org">www.ibtnetwork.org</a> <a href ="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>), a network of behavioral medicine researchers and trialists whose mission is to foster global improvement in the quality of behavioral trials and in trial implementation, and to share a repository for existing recommendations, tools, and methodology on behavioral trials and intervention development. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases 7th Annual Scientific Meeting</strong><br>
 Gary Ellison attended the <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://www.gacd.org/research/research-network/gacd-annual-scientific-meeting-2018">Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) 7th Annual Scientific Meeting </a> <a href ="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>in Sao Paulo, Brazil, November 12-16, 2018. The GACD is a collaboration of 14 major international funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, to address chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and vulnerable populations in high-income countries. The NCD focus is particularly relevant given the changing landscape of disease in LMICs. Dr. Ellison represented NCI. Representatives from Fogarty International Center, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke also were in attendance. A primary focus of funded projects that make up the current GACD Network is implementation science research in four disease areas: lung diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and mental health. The annual scientific meeting focused on facilitating collaboration across sites, GACD Network infrastructure, and capacity building. In addition, there has been interest among the network to be more attentive to multimorbidity, given that two or more NCDs often coexist. Consequently, sessions revolved around scaling up interventions in low-resource settings, data standardization and sharing across the network and disease domains, and the development of joint publications. Cancer prevention will be the next topic of the joint call for proposals.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C)-Childhood Leukemia International (CLIC) </strong><br>

 Sandra Mitchell, Roxanne Jensen, and Ashley Wilder Smith attended the <a style="color: #02561c;" href="http://www.isoqol.org/2018annualconference">annual research meeting of the International Society of Quality of Life</a> <a href ="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a> (ISOQOL) in Dublin, Ireland, October 24-27, 2018. Each gave podium and/or poster presentations on several different topics, and held meetings with collaborators and grantees. </p>
<p>Dr. Mitchell gave a podium presentation reporting the results of the study she led to translate and linguistically validate the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE™) item library in 10 languages (Czech, Russian, Hungarian, Polish, Greek, Canadian-French, European-French, Traditional Chinese, Spanish and German) in 15 countries. She also co-authored two poster presentations, one focused on reporting results from the linguistic validation study of the PRO-CTCAE-Dutch, and another reporting results from a study that used focus group methodology to examine patient and survivor perspectives on sharing patient-generated health data with state cancer registries. </p>
<p>Dr. Smith presented a poster that was based on the MY-Health study and analyzed clinical cutoff scores for patient-reported outcome measures reported by breast cancer patients in a population-based study. Following the ISOQOL meeting, Dr. Smith participated in the PROMIS Health Organization (PHO) meeting, giving a keynote presentation tracing the history of NIH support for the development and use of PROMIS, including describing the key next steps for NIH with respect to the continued development of this measurement system. Dr. Smith also attended several educational sessions during the PHO meeting focused on international metrics for PROMIS and topics related to uptake in clinical settings.</p>
<p>Dr. Jensen participated on the symposium panel &ldquo;Methods for aiding interpretation of and acting on PRO scores in clinical practice,&rdquo; where she discussed the value of reporting cancer-specific PRO reference values to patients and providers to enhance the interpretation and utility of patient-reported outcome measures. Dr. Jensen also presented a poster evaluating the 6-month responsiveness of the PROMIS-Preference (PROPr) Utility measure in a cancer population. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Improving Standardization and Data Quality in Caribbean Cancer Registries </strong><br>
 DCCPS hosted a 4-day workshop on Improving Standardization and Data Quality in Caribbean Cancer Registries on October 22-25, 2018, that was facilitated through the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) lead Cancer Registries Hub. Managers from 12 cancer registries in Caribbean countries attended. Faculty included DCCPS staff, the NAACCR Executive Director, a SEER PI, and three leaders in the IARC-GICR network of trainers. The focus was on operations, management, coding, and quality appropriate for countries with limited resources. Webinars are planned for 2019 to address technical issues identified by the participants; e.g., the first two scheduled are on SEER analytic tools for global cancer registry data (see <a style="color: #02561c;" href="https://education.naaccr.org/analytic-tools-webinars">https://education.naaccr.org/analytic-tools-webinars</a> <a href ="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src ="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" /></a>). </p>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">Ideas on digital health interventions for cancer prevention generated at NCI-CRUK &lsquo;Sandpit&rsquo;</strong><br>
 In late October 2018, the division&rsquo;s Behavioral Research Program partnered with Cancer Research UK (CRUK) to host a &ldquo;Sandpit&rdquo; workshop (i.e., ideas lab). During this intensive residential workshop, which was co-led by Kara Hall, participants formed multidisciplinary teams to generate novel ideas for advancing cancer prevention through the effective implementation of digital health tools. Projects included the following:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>&ldquo;<strong style="color: #02561c;">E-MUte,</strong>&rdquo; which proposes to develop a    valid and reliable algorithm to identify misinformation about e-cigarettes    viewed by adult smokers on social media, identify the mechanism of effects    of misinformation exposure on behavior, and develop intervention    strategies based on these findings. </li>
  <li><strong style="color: #02561c;">&ldquo;Free Time for Wellness (FT4W),&rdquo;</strong> which    proposes to improve social cohesion and promote wellness activities    through the formation of wellness groups of    proximally located low-income mothers using an existing    neighborhood-based social networking platform. </li>
  <li><strong style="color: #02561c;">&ldquo;Project OptiMine,&rdquo;</strong> which    proposes to use EHR systems to identify high-risk patients who may benefit    from cancer prevention interventions and then use digital communication    strategies to reach out to them and refer them to evidence-based programs. </li>
  <li><strong style="color: #02561c;">&ldquo;ShopSmarter,&rdquo;</strong> which    proposes to utilize a newly developed browser extension that overlays a    real-world online shopping website to test whether 1) removing promotions    on junk food or 2) removing product packaging images affects food    purchases.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 8th Conference of Parties</strong><br>
