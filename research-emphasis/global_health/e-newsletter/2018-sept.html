<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">IARC Caribbean Regional Hub for Cancer Registration</strong><br>
  The Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) officially launched the IARC Caribbean Regional Hub for Cancer Registration on June 12, 2018, during the meeting of the Chief Medical Officers of Health in St. Kitts and Nevis by Freddie Bray, Head of IARC&rsquo;s Cancer Surveillance Section, together with James Hospedales, Executive Director of CARPHA. Damali Martin represented NCI at this event as well as contributed to the cancer sessions of the CARHA scientific conference.</p>
<p>The IARC Caribbean Cancer Registry Hub is a partnership between IARC, CARPHA, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), NCI, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). NCI and CDC have provided direct funding support as well as technical expertise (along with NAACCR) for numerous activities performed under the Hub, including technical training workshops, assessments of cancer registry operations in four countries, and statistical analysis of cancer registry data for two registries.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #02561c;">US Embassy Science Fellowship, Warsaw, Poland</strong><br>
  Last Spring, Mark Parascandola of the Tobacco Control Research Branch completed a 3-month Embassy Science Fellowship based at the US Embassy in Warsaw, Poland. The primary goal of the fellowship was to provide technical assistance and develop US-Poland scientific collaborations around air pollution and health. Dr. Parascandola met with a wide variety of experts in health and air quality measurement around Poland. He developed ongoing research projects on air pollution and lung cancer with experts at the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology in Warsaw and with the Faculty of Public Health in Bytom, part of the Medical University of Silesia. He also contributed to Embassy Warsaw&rsquo;s public diplomacy efforts by participating in public forums and sharing information about US programs and research related to air pollution and cancer. In April, Dr. Parascandola was an invited keynote speaker at the Second International Congress on Patient Empowerment, organized by the Instytut Komunikacji Zdrowotnej (Institute for Health Communication), with support from the Ministry of Health. He also served as a speaker and faculty member at a training workshop for journalists organized by Journalists for Health. On April 18, along with Warsaw Polytechnic University epidemiologist Professor Artur Badyda, he participated in the City of Warsaw&rsquo;s monthly &ldquo;Wednesdays with Experts,&rdquo; series, leading a lively discussion and Q&amp;A on air pollution realities and challenges in Poland and the US. </p>
