      Health is a highly-valued, visible, and concrete investment that has the power to both save lives and enhance the credibility of the United States in the eyes of the world. While the United States has made a major commitment to global health, there remains a wide gap between existing knowledge and tools that could improve health if applied universally, and the utilization of these known tools across the globe.</p>
      
      <p>In 2008, the Institute of Medicine convened the expert Committee on the U.S. Commitment to Global Health to investigate the U.S. commitment to global health and to articulate a vision for future U.S. investments. In its 2009 report, The U.S. Commitment to Global Health: Recommendations for the Public and Private Sectors, the committee concludes that the U.S. government and U.S.-based foundations, universities, nongovernmental organizations, and commercial entities have an opportunity to improve global health.<br />

      The Roundtable on Translating Genomic-Based Research for Health held the public workshop &#34;Innovations in Service Delivery in the Age of Genomics&#34; on July 27, 2008. The workshop set out to examine the current system of genetic service delivery, learn about some pioneering current practice models, and propose new models for integrating genetic and genomic innovations into education, training, and clinical practice. Participants discussed the strengths and challenges of the current system and considered a vision for the future of genetic and genomic services, which may not be so distant after all.<br />

Workshop Summary</strong><br />
      To help address the challenges in overcoming this potential crisis of cancer care, the National Cancer Policy Forum of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened the workshop “Ensuring Quality Cancer Care through the Oncology Workforce: Sustaining Care in the 21st Century” in Washington, DC on October 20 and 21, 2008. Workshop participants discussed how to address both the shortage in the oncology workforce as well as the health care workforce as a whole, to ensure the workforce does not become overburdened and is prepared to meet the growing number of patients in need of cancer care.<br />

Workshop Summary" width="100" height="152" border="1" align="left" style="padding-right:15px;"><strong>Health Literacy, eHealth, and Communication: Putting the Consumer First. Workshop Summary</strong><br />
      There is great enthusiasm over the use of emerging interactive health information technologies—often referred to as eHealth—and the potential these technologies have to improve the quality, capacity, and efficiency of the health care system. However, many doctors, advocacy groups, policy makers and consumers are concerned that electronic health systems might help individuals and communities with greater resources while leaving behind those with limited access to technology. Even if equal access to technology could be ensured, most health websites are designed for people with a strong understanding of health information, also known as health literacy. Yet with the average U.S. adult reading at an eighth grade level, many people may be ill-equipped to take advantage of new health technologies even if they can access them.</p>
      
      <p>In order to address this problem, the Institute of Medicine’s Roundtable on Health Literacy held a workshop to explore the current status of communication technology, the challenges for its use in populations with low health literacy, and the strategies for increasing the benefit of these technologies for populations with low health literacy. The summary of the workshop, Health Literacy, eHealth, and Communication: Putting the Consumer First, includes participants&#8217; comments on these issues.<br />

Workshop Summary</strong><br />
      During a time of economic uncertainty, the national discussion of health reform understandably focuses on insurance coverage and cost. To receive the greatest value for health care, it is important to focus on issues of quality and disparity, and the ability of individuals to make appropriate decisions based on basic health knowledge and services, or health literacy. As health care practitioners often see patients from diverse cultures who speak different languages and have a wide range of individual needs, practitioners must ensure all patients receive the same quality of care.</p>
      
      <p>Three IOM bodies (the Forum on the Science of Health Care Quality Improvement and Implementation, the Roundtable on Health Disparities, and the Roundtable on Health Literacy) jointly convened a workshop, &#34;Toward Health Equity and Patient-Centeredness: Integrating Health Literacy, Disparities Reduction, and Quality Improvement,&#34; on May 12, 2008, to discuss these concerns.<br />

      <p><img src="images/auc_cover.gif" alt="Cover - America's Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care" width="100" height="150" border="1" align="left" style="padding-right:15px;"><strong>America&#8217;s Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care</strong><br />
      The growing number of uninsured Americans—totaling 45.7 million as of 2007—is taking a toll on the nation’s health. One in five adults under age 65 and nearly one in ten children are uninsured. Uninsured individuals experience much more risk to their health than insured individuals. In its 2009 report "America’s Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care," the Institute of Medicine points to a chasm between the health care needs of people without health insurance and access to effective health care services. This gap results in needless illness, suffering, and even death.</p>
      
      <p>Now is the time for action, say the report’s authors, recommending that the President work with Congress and other public and private sector leaders on an urgent basis to achieve health insurance coverage for everyone and, in order to make that coverage sustainable, to reduce the costs of health care and the rate of increase in health care spending.<br />

Workshop Summary</strong><br />
      The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Cooperative Group Program is one of the primary venues for the conduct of cancer clinical trials. The cooperative groups collectively recruit roughly 22,000 patients in more than 1,700 institutions to participate in multi-center clinical trials each year. Compared to industry clinical trials, the Cooperative Group Program conducts more trials focused on the best management of disease rather than on specific agents, and includes trials on cancer prevention, early detection, and comparative effectiveness.</p>
      
      <p>The NCI-sponsored cooperative groups have made important contributions to improving treatment for many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, colorectal, and childhood cancers. Cooperative group research has been instrumental in establishing innovative treatments that improve outcomes and quality of life. Despite these successes, the Cooperative Group Program has faced a number of challenges that threaten its effectiveness, including cumbersome, complex processes that have created inefficiencies, flat budgetary allocations, and lagging patient and physician participation.</p>
      
      <p>To address this problem, the National Cancer Policy Forum (NCPF) convened a workshop titled &#34;Multi-Center Phase III Clinical Trials and NCI Cooperative Groups&#34; in Washington, DC, on July 1-2, 2008. The proceedings of this workshop will serve as an input to an IOM committee examining the role of the NCI cooperative groups in the conduct of cancer clinical trial. That committee’s consensus report is scheduled for release in spring 2010.<br />

      Cancer is generally low or absent on the health agenda of most the world’s low- and middle-income countries (LMCs), even as it is growing as a share of these countries’ overall disease burden.  In light of this situation, the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study the issue and provide an assessment and recommendations to tackle the problem. In response, the IOM has produced a report, Cancer Control Opportunities in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.<br />

	  To further curb smoking in the United States requires not only strengthening current tobacco control measures, but also creating a stronger role for federal oversight of the production, promotion, and sale of tobacco products, says a new report from the Institute of Medicine. Among other steps, the report recommends a combination of higher excise taxes, indoor smoking bans nationwide, and regulation of marketing and distribution.<br />

      <p><strong>Seafood Choices: Balancing Benefits and Risks</strong><br />
      The expert committee for <em>Seafood Choices: Balancing Benefits and Risks</em> was asked to prioritize the potential for adverse health effects from both naturally-occurring and introduced toxicants in seafood; assess evidence on availability of specific nutrients in seafood compared to other food sources; determine the impact of modifying food choices to reduce intake of naturally-occurring and introduced toxicants on nutrient intake and nutritional status within the US population; develop a decision path for US consumers to weigh their seafood choices to obtain nutritional benefits balanced against exposure risks; and identify data gaps and recommend future research.  To address the task of assessing benefit/risk trade-offs, the committee took a three-step approach: 1) analysis and balancing of the benefits and risks (including attention to characteristics that distinguish target populations as well as substitution predictions); 2) analysis of consumer perceptions and decision-making (understanding decision contexts and their variability, and assessing consumers’ behavior regarding how they perceive and make choices); and 3) design and evaluation of the decision support program itself (including format and structure of information, media, and combination of communication products and processes).<br />

	  Citing shortfalls in the care currently provided to the country's 10 million cancer survivors, <em>From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition</em> recommends that each cancer patient receive a "survivorship care plan." Such plans should summarize information critical to the individual's long-term care, such as the cancer diagnosis, treatment, and potential consequences; the timing and content of follow-up visits; tips on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing recurrent or new cancers; legal rights affecting employment and insurance; and the availability of psychological and support services.<br />

	  Children's health has made tremendous strides over the past century. In general, life expectancy has increased by more than thirty years since 1900 and much of this improvement is due to the reduction of infant and early childhood mortality. Given this trajectory toward a healthier childhood, we begin the 21st-century with a shocking development-an epidemic of obesity in children and youth. The increased number of obese children throughout the U.S. during the past 25 years has led policymakers to rank it as one of the most critical public health threats of the 21st-century. Preventing Childhood Obesity provides a broad-based examination of the nature, extent, and consequences of obesity in U.S. children and youth, including the social, environmental, medical, and dietary factors responsible for its increased prevalence. The book also offers a prevention-oriented action plan that identifies the most promising array of short-term and longer-term interventions, as well as recommendations for the roles and responsibilities of numerous stakeholders in various sectors of society to reduce its future occurrence. Preventing Childhood Obesity explores the underlying causes of this serious health problem and the actions needed to initiate, support, and sustain the societal and lifestyle changes that can reverse the trend among our children and youth.<br />

        The importance of behavioral, social, economic, and environmental influences on health is increasingly recognized. The relationships among genetic factors, social influences, and the physical environment are now of growing interest to the research, policy, public health, and clinical communities. The Institute of Medicine brought together experts and collaborators at a symposium in May 2001. The resulting reports are the starting point for assessing the status of behavioral and social science research relating to health, identifying where the greatest opportunities appear to lie in translating this research, and recognizing the barriers that impede progress. <br>

      Each year more than 180,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women in the U.S. If cancer is detected when small and local, treatment options are less dangerous, intrusive, and costly -- and more likely to lead to a cure. Yet those simple facts belie the complexity of developing and disseminating acceptable techniques for breast cancer diagnosis. Even the most exciting new technologies remain clouded with uncertainty. Mammography and Beyond provides a comprehensive and up-to-date perspective on the state of breast cancer screening and diagnosis and recommends steps for developing the most reliable breast cancer detection methods possible. <br>

	  Palliative care should be integrated into cancer care from diagnosis to death. But significant barriers &#8211; attitudinal, behavioral, economic, educational, and legal &#8211; still limit access to care for a large proportion of those dying from cancer. In spite of tremendous scientific opportunities for medical progress against all the major symptoms associated with cancer and cancer death, public research institutions have not responded. This report identifies the special needs of cancer patients and the importance of the clinical and research establishment involved in cancer care to take a leadership role in modeling the best quality care from diagnosis to death for all Americans.<br>

        Tobacco control programs can reduce tobacco use and can incorporate many different elements modeled on existing state programs that have proved effective. The effects of counteradvertising and education depend on their "intensity" and "dose." Smoke-free work site policies reduce illness and death from involuntary smoking, increase smoking cessation, and reduce consumption among continuing smokers.
