        <p><strong>Answers</strong></p>
		<ol>
		  <li><a name="1"></a><strong>Can a PI with a grant that is currently co-funded by NCI apply for this competing supplement?</strong><br>
		  To be eligible to apply for this competing supplement NCI must be the primary institute on co-funded grants. If NCI is the secondary funding institute then the grant is not eligible for this supplement.</li><br><br>
		
		  <li><a name="2"></a><strong>Is it sufficient to make the case for the potential public health and/or clinical significance of an intervention if the randomized trial in the parent grant does not end until after the application receipt deadline and the PI does not have final data showing that the intervention has achieved statistical significance?</strong><br>
		  The application instructions states " The purpose of these administrative supplements is to fund the dissemination of promising interventions and products that have been developed and tested in the original R01, P01, P50, U01, or U19 (Type 1) project. These interventions include those for which statistical significance and potential public health/clinical significance suggest the merits of dissemination to the broader population from which the intervention study sample was originally drawn." The NIH Guide Notice states "the supplement is designed to provide funding to investigators whose efficacy data have been analyzed." With this in mind, if the randomized control trial will not be complete prior to the application receipt date it would be important to provide preliminary analyses that have been completed by 5/15/05 with the application that are indicative of what the final analyses may show.</li><br><br>
		  
		  <li><a name="3"></a><strong>If a project grant consists of multiple component projects and the PI for the grant is not Project Leader of the component project that will be proposed for dissemination may the current Project Leader be the PI on the RFA supplement submitted to the NCI? </strong><br>
		 The proposed dissemination projects are going to be awarded as supplements to existing grants - so the PI has to be the same on the supplement as on the parent grant. NCI can't supplement an individual component of a grant.</li><br><br>
		 
		 <li><a name="4"></a><strong>If the PI of the parent grant is going to retire after the application receipt date can a new PI be listed on the application submitted?</strong><br>
		 The PI requesting a supplement must be the same as the PI on the parent grant. If the PI of the parent is going to retire he/she can either change the PI of the parent grant prior to submission of the application and list the new PI on the application for the supplement or include his/her name on the application for the supplement and change the PI on the parent grant and the supplement if the supplement is awarded funding.</li><br><br>
		 
		 <li><a name="5"></a><strong>If a grant has ended would it be possible to apply for this supplement?</strong><br>
		 Yes, if the parent grant has ended there are two possible ways to apply for this supplement:
		 <ol type="a">
		   <li>Investigators that have submitted a competing continuation application (Type 2) of their R01, P01, P50, U01 or U19 intervention research award may submit the supplement application if the Type 2 application does not include funding for the dissemination effort. In this particular case, the Type 2 must be awarded before 9/30/05 and the supplement (if awarded) will be linked to the Type 2 award to disseminate the evidence-based intervention tested in the original R01, P01, P50, U01 or U19 (Type 1) project</li>
		   <li>Applicants may apply for a supplement to a related R01, P01, P50, U01 or U19 intervention research award, as long as the focus of this award is similar to the focus of the intervention dissemination supplement that is being proposed, the PI of the related grant is the same as the PI of the parent grant in which the intervention was originally evaluated, and there are no funds in the related award related to the proposed dissemination effort.</li>
