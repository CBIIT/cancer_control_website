	<h2>General Advice for Preparing an NIH Grant Application</h2>
    <a name="how to write"></a>
		<h3>How to Write an NIH Grant Application</h3>
            <p>A strong grant application begins with a good idea. This idea must be developed using a good scientific approach coupled with a rigorous, well-defined experimental plan. Finally the job is not done until the information is presented in clear language that follows the rules and guidelines set forth in the Grant Application PHS 398 form.</p>
            <p><strong>A GOOD IDEA</strong></p>
				<ol>
                 <a name="good idea"></a>
                	<p><strong>Starting Questions</strong></p>
                  	<li>Do you know what is important in your field?</li>
                    <li>Have you reviewed priority-setting resources at NCI?</li>
                    <li>Do you know the field and its literature?</li>
                    <li>Is the field overpopulated?</li>
                    <li>Is the scope of the problem achievable?</li></ol>
             		<p>If you answered "yes" to the fourth question or "no" to any of the others, go back and reassess what you want to do; otherwise, you are going to have difficulty getting it funded.</p>
    				<p><strong>The Hypothesis</strong></p>
                    
					<p>A tentative explanation for certain behaviors, phenomena, or events that have occurred or will occur.</p>
        <ul>
        		<li>Rationale for the hypothesis</li>
        		<li>A set of related aims</li>
        		<li>Aims that are focused and not diffuse
                  <ul>
                    <li>Rarely more than 3 overall hypotheses with 2-3 aims</li>
                    <li>Operationalize</li>
                    <li>Null and directional</li>
                    <li>Implications if hypotheses are/are not supported</li>
                  </ul>
          	      <p><strong>Preliminary Data</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Proper training to do what you propose</li>
                    <li>Interpret the results critically</li>
                    <li>Alternative meanings for the results</li>
                  </ul>
          
                        <p>Preliminary data may consist of your own publications, publications of others, unpublished data from your own laboratory or from another, or some combination of these.</p>
                  <p>If your idea is not hypothesis-driven or if you do not have preliminary data from either your own work or others to indicate that the idea is scientifically sound, stop now and think again. You're not likely to get this work funded, no matter how clever you think the idea is. Two good rules of thumb that you should remember are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Avoid "Descriptive Data Gathering"</li>
                    <li>Emphasize Mechanism</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
                <p>A grant application that emphasizes descriptive science and fails to ask questions about mechanism is not going to be successful.</p>
                <p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Literature search and preliminary draft of relevant materials</li>
                    <li>Look up publications of reviewers</li>
                    <li>Use only those articles which are relevant to support aims</li>    		        <li>Theoretical model(s)</li>
        <li>Essential in intervention level studies</li>
        <li>on-essential or inappropriate for exploratory level</li>
        <li>If no model, explain why</li>
        <li>When possible, use diagram</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

    		<p>Your institution and contracts office can help you with administrative details and reviews for things such as human subjects.</p>
            <p>If you do not follow the rules, your application may be returned without being reviewed.</p>
            <p><strong>Get an Outside Opinion</strong></p>
            <p>Find colleagues in your field who are experienced, successful grant writers and preferably grant reviewers (that is, they have been members of NIH Study Sections). The more critical and picky they are, the better. Have them review your application before you submit it. Better to know the problems now than learn about them from the NIH Study Section when your application gets an unfundable score.</p>
	<p>Remember, to get funded, two things need to happen:</p>
    	<ol>
        	<li><p><strong>YOU need to write a strong application</strong></p></li>
					<strong>AND</strong>
            <li><strong>Someone who is interested in the subject of your research (your PEERS) needs to review it.</strong> Let the NIH referral system decide who, among your peers, should be in the Study Section to review your application; they choose correctly the vast majority of the time. If you have questions about the suitability and/or expertise of the Study Section after you read their review (summary statement), you can do something about it.</li>
</ol>
		<p><strong>How to Revise Your Grant Application</strong></p>
        
        <p>What if you submit a grant application and it does not get funded? Don't give up - you are in good company. The NIH allows you to revise and resubmit the application; however, only two revisions are allowed.</p>
        <p><strong>Read and Reread the Summary Statement</strong></p>
        <p>This document is the official summary of the Study Section review. (Old timers remember that is was also called a "pink sheet" because it used to be printed on pink paper).</p>	<p><strong>What Are the Problems?</strong></p>
        <p>Poorly written? Confusing Information? Insufficient information (e.g., in the experimental plan)? Have I clearly and convincingly stated the significance of the problem? Is the research feasible? Can I do it? Can anyone do it? What is unique about my research? Have I told the reviewers?</p>
	<p>Productivity? Have I clearly indicated the obstacles to accomplishing my goals, and what the alternatives are should my approaches not work?</p>
	<p><strong>What Can I Do About It?</strong></p>
		<ul>
   		<p><strong>The problems are repairable.</strong></p>
        	<ul>
            	<li>Revise and resubmit to the same study section</li>
		<p><strong>The problems are not repairable.</strong></p>
       <li>Philosophical problems (if they do not believe the work is important, they are not interested in the subject or they are not the proper peers then they are never going to get sufficiently excited about the grant to give it a fundable score.</li>
        <li>Suitable expertise is not available on the Study Section that reviewed your grant</li>
        <li>Perceived bias</li>
        <p>But remember, even your direct competitors have to like your subject—after all, they do their research on that subject, too. Bias is often counterproductive. The rest of the reviewers will be alert to bias and argue against it vigorously if they perceive that a competitor is not being fair and objective.</p>
        <li>Revise, resubmit, and request a different study section. (See directions under Cover letter.)</li>
        <p><strong>Fatal Flaws and Weaknesses</strong></p>
		<p>Are the reviewers correct? - the work may not be feasible, or sufficiently important, or you may not be capable of doing it.</p>
        <li>Rethink the problem - should you revise?</li>
	<p><strong>The Response</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Introduction to revised application</strong></p>
    <p>Use this section to summarize all deletions, additions and other changes in the revision. Address all aspects of the critique of the previous review (you need not agree with all of them but you must address them all). Refer to any new preliminary data that you have included to strengthen the application. Indicate changes in the text [a bar in the margin is the best wary].</p>
    <p><strong>Cover letter</strong></p>
    <p>Should you wish to request a different Study Section, do so in a cover letter addressed to the Referral Office of the Center for Scientific Review at NIH. Give reasons for the request; lack of expertise, lack of peer interest in the subject, differing philosophies (e.g., a molecularly oriented review group reviewing a functional application or vice versa). Try to suggest an alternate Study Section. Also, it is best to talk to the program person first.</p>
    </ul>
      </ul>
	<p><strong>Common Problems and Concerns of Grant Reviewers</strong></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>There was insufficient methodological detail provided to convince the reviewers that the investigator knows what he/she is doing (i.e., the proposed experimental approach looks like it was simply copied out of the Current Protocols book and there is no recognition of potential problems and pitfalls).</li>
        <li>Alternative approaches were not provided in case the primary approach does not work out as expected.</li>
        <li>The proposed project is too diffuse and lacks focus.</li>
        <li>The proposed project is a fishing expedition that lacks any solid scientific basis. What is the basic scientific question to be addressed?</li>
        <li>The proposed experiments are merely descriptive and do not test a specific hypothesis.</li>
        <li>A rationale for the proposed experiments was not provided. Why is this experiment important, or how is this experiment relevant to the hypothesis?</li>
        <li>The proposed experiments do not address all of the relevant issues, or do not include all relevant controls.</li>
        <li>The investigator does not have experience (i.e. publications or appropriate preliminary data) with the proposed techniques and has not recruited a collaborator who has the required expertise.</li>
        <li>The proposed studies are based on a "shaky" hypothesis or on "shaky" data.</li>
        <li>The proposed study has little or no functional relevance -- no experiments that address functional relevance are proposed.</li>
        <li>The ability to perform most of the proposed experiments depends on the success of an initial proposed experiment. If the answer to the first question is "no," are all the remaining experiments worthless?</li>
        <li>The proposed model system is not appropriate to address the proposed questions (e.g., don't propose to study T-cell gene expression in a B-cell line).</li>
        <li>The project has little significance to the scientific or clinical issue being addressed.</li>
        <li>The preliminary data do not support the feasibility of the project, or do not support the hypothesis to be tested.</li>
        <li>Important alternative hypotheses or approaches were not considered.</li>
        <li>Why would someone want to do these experiments anyway?</li>
        <li>The proposal is technology driven rather than hypothesis driven.</li>
        <li>The proposal lacks critical literature references. Because of this paucity of references, it is not clear which data the investigator obtained and which were reported by others.</li>
        <li>The proposed experiments have no direction or sense of priority (i.e., the experiments do not follow from one another, or lack a clear starting or finishing point).</li></ol>
