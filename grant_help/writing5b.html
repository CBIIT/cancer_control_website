			<h3>The Grant Writing Process - Writing</h3>
				<h4>Drafting and Revising a Grant Application</h4>
                	<p><strong>Drafting a Grant Application</strong></p>
                    <p>After all of the source materials have been gathered, the researcher is still faced with the task of drafting the grant application. Some researchers follow their outlines closely, composing paragraphs and sentences according to plan. Others recognize that often during the drafting stage ideas emerge that did not appear while they were planning.</p>
                    <p>The researcher is open, in this instance, to the opportunity of discovering through writing new and appropriate ideas and lines of reasoning. Whatever creative thinking surfaces at this point should be given extensive consideration later to make sure it is consistent with all sections of the grant application.</p>
                    <p>Preparation of a grant application is, in many ways, never done. Researchers can always find ways to improve their writing. That is why they find themselves constructing many drafts of the same document and revising a great deal as they go. A better word here, a better way of making the point thereâ€”they write and re-write until they have a final draft that meets their needs and suits the occasion.</p>
                    <p>Drafting a grant application using a word processing program makes the writing/re-writing tasks a bit easier. Words and lines can be deleted and replaced with relative ease; whole blocks of information can be moved and re-arranged at the touch of a few buttons. Drafting, then, is not something that should be seen as only one step in the grant preparation process. Rather, it is part of a on-going process that involves revision as well.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Revising the Grant Application</em></strong></p>
                    <p>After a draft of the grant application has been written and, if possible, laid aside for period of time, it can then be reconsidered and then revised for content and language. During this stage of revision, researchers benefit from the following processes:</p>
                    <p><em><strong><i><u>Step 1: Reconsiderations</u></i></strong></em></p>
                    <p><strong>A. Is the arrangement of the grant application sections effective and conducive to understanding?</strong>
                    <p>Questioning whether the arrangement of the grant application is effective requires going back to the researcher's working outline and asking if the finished product follows it. Also, the researcher may want to reconsider if there is indeed a good reason for having sections of information grouped the way they are. As researchers become more proficient at organization, they recognize that the arrangement of their applications greatly determines their effectiveness.</p>
                    <p><strong>B. Is there a sufficient amount of detail within each section?</strong></p>
                    <p>Nothing is more unconvincing as an overly generalized, under-supported assertion. As search situations change, so often does the degree of development and support. However, given the fact that researcher must work within a 20-page limit, a balance must be achieved between the excessive and convincing amounts of detail.</p>
                    <p><strong>C. Is the material contained in the grant application unified and coherent?</strong></p>
                    <p>Unity and coherence are two characteristics of clear, effective grant applications.</p>
                    <p>First, a written work is unified when all of the discussion and details contained in the document relate to a central argument or thesis. Material that is not unified strays from the point and does not support the purpose.</p>
                    <p>Second, the ideas, concepts, and facts that are presented within a grant application have to stick together. When the reviewer can understand the progression of thought in an application without getting lost or without encountering mind-baffling jumps from point to point, we say the grant application is coherent. Aside from logically ordering their material, researchers must ensure that their grant applications are coherent by using the following techniques:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Applying <a href="">devices of transition</a></li>
                        <li>Using <a href="">pronouns</a></li>
                        <li>Repeating <a href="">key words and phrase</a></li>
				   </ul>
                  <p><strong>D. Reconsiderations Checklist</strong></p>
                  	<ol>
                    	<li>Is the arrangement within sections of the grant application effective?</li>
    					<li>Is there sufficient detail within each section?</li>
    					<li>Is the grant application unified across all sections?</li>
                        <li>Is the grant application coherent?</li>
                        	<ul>
                            	<li>transitions?</li>
                            	<li><a href="">pronouns?</a></li>
                            	<li>repetition of key terms?</li>
							</ul>
                 </ol>
         <p><strong><em><i><u>Step 2: Revising for Readability and Correctness</u></i></em></strong></p>
         <p>Revision also involves taking a closer look at the language of the grant application. If the prose is not conducive to understanding and if the researcher consistently fails to accede to language conventions, then the effectiveness of the grant application can be undermined.</p>
<p>Good "writing style" within grant applications generally means readability and correctness. If a grant application is "readable," it therefore</p>
		<ol>
        	<li>contains <a href="">active verbs</a>,</li>
    		<li>is very concise,</li>
            <li>includes language that is clear and precise, and</li>
            <li>presents sentences with lengths appropriate to the reading habits of reviewers.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>If a grant applications is "correct" linguistically, then the conventions of language such as punctuation, grammar, mechanics, spelling, and usage have been given careful attention. The characteristics of readability are explored in the remainder of this section.</p>
       <p><strong>Revising for Readability</strong></p>
       <p>The only way a reviewer (i.e., a specialist reader) can understand the meaning and significance of a grant application is if the resulting document is readable. Looking back over a grant application with a critical eye, a researcher can take important steps toward readability by checking it for the following items.</p>
       <ul>
       		<li><a href="">Active Verbs</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Concise language</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Key Word Editing</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Clear, Precise Language</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Appropriate Sentence Length</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Revising for Correctness</a></li>
       </ul> 
    <p><strong>Checklist for Readability and Correctness</strong></p>
    <p>Following is a Revision Checklist for improving revising for readability and correctness, including proofreader's marks and pages for further discussion.</p>
<p>Readability</p>
	<ul>
    	<li><a href="">Active Verbs</a></li>

       <br />
       <li><strong><em><i><u>Grammar</u></i></em></strong> (sentence structure, verb tense, subject-verb agreement, pronoun types, pronoun agreement, pronoun, reference, adjective and adverbs, adverb placement, dangling modifiers, parallelism)</li>
       <li><strong><em><i><u>Mechanics</u></i></em></strong> (capitals, abbreviations, numbers, italics)</li>
