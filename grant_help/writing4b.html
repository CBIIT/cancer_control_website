        <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
        <p>Rarely can a study be developed without considering the results   obtained in past research. Because no study is perfect or addresses all   the questions that may arise about a given research topic, fresh   empirical questions can be inspired from articles published in peer   reviewed journals or from presentations at professional meetings.</p>
        <p>To develop a testable, timely <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>,   investigators are advised to use a logical progression of ideas.   Whereas a study or a brief series of studies can be used as a &quot;seed&quot; for   a specific research idea, investigators should become highly familiar   with bulk of the research in the area of interest. This knowledge will   prevent redundancies across studies and provide the researcher with the   problems encountered and knowledge yielded by other researchers.</p>
        <p>Because researchers generate and refine ideas based previous work,   hypotheses tend to diverge or &quot;branch out&quot; from the  research question   that spawned the subsequent research. Eventually, many of these ideas   become more refined, yielding more branches of the research tree. As the   field develops, some branches will develop no further, perhaps because   the concepts associated with that branch are no longer of interest to   funding agencies or less frequently to qualified researchers. That is,   the information that is currently available is all that is required for   the time being, or for other less obvious reasons, the domain is no   longer one that attracts research activity. Therefore, the key element   in generating a <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> is to develop an empirical question that will advance a field of   knowledge in a timely manner; a study designed only to replicate a   previous study is seldom of value and is usually considered a waste of   time and money by funding institutions and other researchers.</p>
        <p>Additional steps — Merely a very preliminary step has been   accomplished when the scientist has decided on the research question to   be studied. That is, researchers should develop competing hypotheses   which can be integrated into the study design and which can be tested to   maximize the strength of the study's findings. For example, most social   scientists are at least somewhat knowledgeable about using <a href="desgloss.html#Multivariate-Analyses">multivariate analyses</a> to <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> for the influence of variables that may confound the results. Careful   consideration about which variables to include in the multivariate   equation, however, is sometimes lacking yielding results that are of   dubious value. However, including data in the multivariate equation   variable identified as having the potential to confound the results will   prevent criticisms that the results were <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> at that level. Therefore, a researcher should anticipate alternative   explanations for the expected findings, and design the study in such a   way that these other hypotheses can be tested and presumably ruled out.   Thus, a research study might be  considered as a series (if it has   several components) or one in a series of experiments (or studies), each   one building on knowledge from the previous one.</p>
        <p>Of course, every investigator wants to provide information that is accurate—(i.e., avoid committing a Type I or a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-II-Error">Type II error</a>).   That is, the conclusions about relationships should not be considered   &quot;real&quot; if the relationships are &quot;false,&quot; and not be considered &quot;false&quot;   if the relationships truly exist. Neither a Type I nor a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-II-Error">Type II error</a> is desirable, but committing a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-I-Error">Type I error</a> is somewhat less agreeable than producing a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-II-Error">Type II error</a>.</p>
        <p>These problematic factors include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Poor quality <a href="desgloss.html#Instruments">instruments</a></li>
          <li>Sample not representative of the <a href="desgloss.html#Population-Of-Interest">population of interest</a></li>
          <li><a href="desgloss.html#Sample-Size">Sample size</a> insufficient</li>
          <li>Study design <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> against finding a <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> result</li>
          <li><a href="desgloss.html#Third-Variable-Effects">Third variable effects</a> influencing the results</li>
          <li>A <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> of interest in some populations but not others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Error can occur during:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="desgloss.html#Data-Collection">Data collection</a></li>
          <li>Data entry</li>
          <li>Measurement</li>
          <li>The response</li>
          <li>From <a href="desgloss.html#Environmental-Factors">environmental factors</a></li>
          <li>From social desirability</li>
          <li>From <a href="desgloss.html#Random-Error">random error</a></li>
          <li>From poor quality equipment or measures</li>
          <li>From poor calibration of equipment</li>
          <li>In computer programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Certainly these factors, some more than others, may also influence the data toward a <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> result; however, in general these considerations will decrease the likelihood of obtaining <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> result for reasons discussed elsewhere. Of course, despite the above   discussion, the possibility remains when a negative result is obtained   that the findings represent reality and that no <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> exists.</p>
        <p>If an investigator is writing a grant application, addressing the   potential problems listed above may enhance the chances for obtaining   grant funding. For example, a good strategy during the writing of the   grant is to demonstrate both the knowledge that the above problems may   exist in a given study as well as suggest solutions to respond to these   difficulties. The researcher should justify using particular <a href="desgloss.html#Instruments">instruments</a> by providing information on the measure's reliability and <a href="desgloss.html#Validity">validity</a>; a suitable discussion about the appropriateness of the source for the sample is also needed, and <a href="desgloss.html#Power-Calculations">power calculations</a> should be included to demonstrate the size of the sample will be adequate, etc.</p>
