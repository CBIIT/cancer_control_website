      <h2>Step-By-Step Grant Help</h2>
		<h3>The Grant Writing Process - Budgeting</h3>
			<h4>Budgeting Process Glossary</h4>
            	<p><strong>Detailed Budget For First 12-Month Budget Period</strong></p>
                <p>List only the direct costs requested in this application. Do not include any items that are treated by the applicant organization as indirect costs according to a Federal rate negotiation agreement except for those indirect costs included in consortium/contractual costs. For a SUPPLEMENTAL application, show only those items for which additional funds are requested, prorating the personnel costs and other appropriate parts of the detailed budget if the first budget period of the application is less than 12 months. Budget periods of the supplemental must coincide with the budget period of the parent grant. Each item must be clearly justified on the application form.</p>
                <p><strong>Project Personnel</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>Project personnel are the personnel who are to be involved in the proposed research project. Key personnel are those individuals who participate in the scientific development or execution of the projects. Each key person must be listed on the Description and Key Personnel page (page BB). A biographical sketch of each key person is also required and must include a description of the person's education, research, and professional experience.</p>
                <p><em>Instructions On Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>Starting with the PI, list the names and types of appointment of all personnel involved on the project during the initial budget period who are employees of the applicant organization, regardless of whether a salary has been requested. Include all collaborating investigators, individuals in training, and support staff. The PHS does not recognize the co-principal investigator or co-investigator title as different from other collaborators.</p>
                <p><strong>Type Of Appointment</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>The type of appointment indicates the working arrangement personnel have with the applicant organization. This may be a full-time or part-time, 12-month, 9-month or other arrangement.</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>List the number of months per year reflected in an individual's contractual appointment to the applicant organization. PHS staff assume that appointments at the applicant organization are full-time for each individual. If an appointment is less than full-time (i.e., 1/2 time or 3/4), enter an asterisk (*) after the number of months and provide a full explanation under Justification. Individuals may have split appointments, for example, for an academic period and a summer period. For each appointment, identify and enter the number of months on separate lines. In cases where no contractual appointment exists with the applicant organization and salary is being requested, enter the number of months for that period.</p>
                <p><strong>Percentage Of Appointment</strong></p>
                <p>Percentage of appointment is defined as the percentage of the person's appointment that will be devoted to the project.</p>
                <p>Column 2 of the First 12-month Budget (Page DD) indicates the percentage of each appointment at the applicant organization to be devoted to this project. Enter the appropriate separate lines the percentages for the academic and summer periods. If an individual engages in other institutional responsibilities, such as teaching, the total percentage devoted to all research activities by the individual must be less than 100%.</p>
                <p><strong>Effort On The Project</strong></p>
                <p>Percent of effort on project indicates the percent of each appointment at the applicant organization to be spent on this project.</p>
                <p><strong>Salary</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>Compensation for personal services covers all amounts paid or accrued by the organization for services rendered to the project. These costs are allowable to the extent that they are reasonable and conform to the established, consistently applied policy of the organization, and reflect no more than the percentage of time actually devoted to the PHS-funded project. [PHS Grants Policy Statement, p. 36]</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em>
                <p><i>Institutional Base Salary</i> - Institutional base salary is defined as the annual compensation that the applicant organization pays for the individual's appointment, whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Base salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the applicant organization. Base salary may not be increased as a result of replacing institutional salary funds with grant funds. An applicant organization may choose to leave this column blank. However, PHS staff may require this information prior to award.</p>
                <p><i>Salary Requested</i> - Enter the dollar amounts for each position for which funds are requested. The maximum salary that may be requested is calculated by multiplying the individual's base salary, defined above, by the percent of the effort on this project. If a lesser amount is requested for any position, explain under Justification, on form page 5 (for example, endowed position, institutional sources, other support). Congress has imposed and may continue to impose salary caps. Applicants are encouraged to contact their offices of sponsored programs or refer to the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts for current guidance.</p>
                <p><strong>Fringe Benefits</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>Allowable in proportion to the amount of time or effort employees devote to the grant-supported project, provided such costs are incurred under formally established and consistently applied policies of the organization.</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>Fringe benefits may be requested in accordance with the existing rate agreement for each position provided such costs are treated consistently by the applicant organization as a direct cost to all sponsors.</p>
                <p><strong>Consultant Costs</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>A consultant is an individual hired to give professional advice or services for a fee but not as an employee of the hiring party. The term "consultant" also includes a firm that provides paid professional advice or services. Grant recipients are expected to have policies governing their use of consultants that are consistently applied regardless of the source of support, and are expected to justify using consultants instead of salaried employees. [PHS Grants Policy Statement, p.30]</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>Whether or not costs are involved, provide the names and organizational affiliations of any consultants (other than those involved in consortium/contractual arrangements) who have agreed to serve in that capacity. Include consultant physicians in connection with patient care.</p>
                <p>Briefly describe and justify the services to be performed, including the number of days of consultation, the expected rate of compensation, travel, per diem, and other related costs.</p>                <p><strong>Equipment Costs</strong><p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>Equipment is defined as an article of tangible personal property having a useful life of more than 2 years and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. [PHS Grants Policy Statement, p. 3]</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>List separately each item of equipment with a unit acquisition cost of $500 or more. Justify the purchase in the Justification field.</p>
                <p><strong>Supply Costs</strong></p>
                <p>Itemize supplies in separate categories such as glassware, chemicals, radioisotopes, etc. Categories totaling less than $1,000 do not have to be itemized. However, if animals are involved, state the species, the number used, their unit purchase cost, their unit care cost, and the number of care days.</p>
                <p><strong>Travel Costs</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>Allowable as a direct cost where such travel will provide direct benefit to the project. According to the organization's established travel policy, such costs for employees working on the grant-supported project may include associated per diem or subsistence allowances and other travel related expenses such as mileage if travel is by personal automobile.</p>
                <p>If the recipient organization has no formal travel policy, HHS travel regulations, including maximum per diem and subsistence rates prescribed in those regulations, shall be used to determine the amount for travel costs. This information may be requested from the PHS awarding office and is in the HHS Travel Manual for public inspection and copying at HHS and Regional Office information centers. [PHS Grants Policy Statement, p. 40]</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>State the purpose of any travel, under Justification, form page 5, giving the number of trips involved, the destinations, and the number of individuals for whom funds are requested.</p>
                <p><strong>Patient Care Costs</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>Allowable to provide routine and ancillary medical services on either an inpatient or outpatient basis if the recipient has obtained prior approval from PHS for the need to treat patients and to incur patient care costs in the project receiving grant support. Patient care costs where the need to incur such costs has not previously been approved by PHS and rebudgeting out of patient care costs must have prior approval by PHS.</p>
                <p>Items for personal expense reimbursement, such as patient travel, consulting physician fees, or any other direct payments to patients, including inpatients, outpatients, subjects, volunteers, and donors are unallowable as patient care costs, but may be allowable in other cost categories such as consultant or other expenses (see COMPLETING THE FORM in this section).</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>If inpatient and outpatient charges incident to the research are requested, on page 5 provide the names of the hospitals or clinics to be used and the amounts requested for each. State whether each hospital or clinic has a currently effective DHHS-negotiated patient care rate agreement, and if not, what basis is used for calculating charges. If there is "limited" patient care activity that does not require the establishment of a DHHS-negotiated rate, and institutional patient care rate may be provisionally approved by the PHS awarding component. Indicate in detail the basis for estimating costs in this category, including the number of patient days, estimated cost per day, and cost per test or treatment. Patient care costs do not include travel, lodging, and subsistence or donor/volunteer fees; request these costs in the "Other Expenses" category. Request physician consultant fees in the "Consultant Costs" category. Patient care costs will be provided to foreign organizations only in exceptional circumstances.</p>
                <p><strong>Alterations And Renovations</strong></p>
                <p><em>General Definition And Description</em></p>
                <p>Alterations and renovations is defined as work required to change the interior arrangements or other physical characteristics of an existing facility or installed equipment so that it may be more effectively utilized for its currently designated purpose or adapted to an alternative use to meet a programmatic requirement. Routine maintenance and repair of the organization's physical plant or its equipment is not considered to be alteration and renovation. Certain costs of installing equipment, such as the temporary removal and replacement of wall sections and door frames, in order to place equipment in the permanent location or the costs of connecting utility lines, replacing finishes and furnishings, and installing any accessory devices required for the equipment's proper and safe utilization, may be considered either equipment costs or alteration and renovation costs depending on the recipient accounting system. [PHS Grants Policy Statement, pages 27-28]</p>
                <p>New construction is generally not allowable. Many other restrictions and exemptions exist regarding alteration and renovation costs. Consult the PHS Grants Policy Statement for more information.</p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>The costs of construction, per se, are not permissible charges. If the costs of essential alterations of facilities, including repairs, painting, removal, or installation of partitions, shielding, or air conditioning, are requested, itemize them by category and justify them fully on page 5. When applicable, indicate the square footage involved, giving the basis for the costs, such as an architect's or contractor's detailed estimate. When possible, submit a line drawing of the alterations being proposed. Cost for alterations and renovations are not allowed on grants made to foreign applicant organizations.</p>
                <p><strong>Consortium/Contractual Costs</strong></p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>Each participating consortium/contractual organization must submit a separate detailed budget for the initial budget period and for the entire proposed project periods using copies of form pages 4 and 5.</p>
                <p>Consortium arrangements may involve costs such as personnel, supplies, and any other allowable expenses, including indirect costs, for the relatively independent conduct of a portion of the work described in the Research Plan. Contractual arrangements for major support services, such as the laboratory testing of biological materials, clinical services, etc., are occasionally also of sufficient scope to warrant a similar categorical breakdown of costs. For either of the above arrangements, enter the total direct costs and indirect costs. A separate budget page must be used for each sub-awardee.</p>
                <p>List the indirect costs and provide the basis for the rate in the Consortium/Contractual Costs category for each supplementary budget page. Insert the page(s) after form page 5 numbering them sequentially. (Do not use 5a, 5b, 5c, etc.)</p>
                <p>The sum of all consortium/contractual costs (direct costs and indirect costs) must be entered in the Consortium/Contractual Costs category of the applicant institution's budget.</p>
                <p><strong>Other Expenses</strong></p>
                <p><em>Completing The Form</em></p>
                <p>Itemize by category and unit cost such other expenses as publication costs, page charges, books, computer charges rentals and leases, equipment maintenance, minor fee-for service contracts, etc.</p>
                <p>Reimbursement is allowable for tuition remission in lieu of all or partial salary for student work on the project. State on page 5 the percentage of tuition requested in proportion to the time devoted to the project.</p>
                <p>Reimbursement is allowable for donor/volunteer fees and for travel, lodging, and subsistence costs incurred by human subjects participating in the project, including travel of an escort, if required. This reimbursement is applicable to all classes of human subjects, including inpatients, outpatients, donors, and normal volunteers, regardless of employment status. Detail such costs on page 5.</p>
                <p><strong>PHS Grants Policy Statement</strong></p>
                <p>This booklet presents a compilation of the salient features of policies and various policy issues that have been raised in the past regarding the administration of PHS grant awards.</p>
                <p><strong>Direct Cost</strong></p>
                <p>A direct cost is any cost that can be specifically identified with a particular project or program. Direct costs may include, but not be limited to, salaries, travel, equipment, and supplies directly benefitting the project or activity.</p>
                <p>These costs are to be included on pages DD and EE of the PHS Grant Application.</p>
                <p><strong>Indirect Cost</strong></p>
                <p>Indirect costs are those incurred by an organization for common or joint objectives and cannot be identified specifically with a particular project or program. Facilities operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, and administrative expenses are examples of costs that are usually treated as indirect costs. These costs are required on the Checklist page of the PHS 398 Grant Application.</p>
                <p>Indirect costs are computed by applying a previously indirect cost rate to some component of the total direct cost amount, such as total direct personnel costs or total direct costs. In most cases the applicant organization must have a negotiated indirect cost rate before applying for a grant.</p>
                <p>The establishment of an indirect cost rate is not necessary if (a) the organization's awards do not provide reimbursement for indirect costs or limit such reimbursement to 8 percent of direct costs, (b) the organization's total operations consist of a single grant supported project, or (c) the organization appropriately and consistently treats all costs as direct costs to projects and accounts for them as such.</p>
                <p>For more information consult the PHS Grants Policy Statement.</p>
                <p><strong>Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate</strong></p>
                <p>In most cases the applicant organization must have a negotiated indirect costs rate before applying for a grant.</p>
                <p>Further information concerning the establishment of indirect cost rates and the reimbursement of indirect costs may be obtained from the offices that negotiate indirect cost rates.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Personnel</strong></p>
                <p>Key personnel are those individuals who participate in the scientific development and execution of the projects. Each key personnel must be listed on the Description and Key Personnel page (page BB). A biographical sketch of each key personnel is also required and must include a description of the person's education, research, and professional experience.</p>
                <p>This category generally include individuals with professional degrees, (i.e., Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S., D.O., D.V.M., B.S.N., or B.S.E.), but in some projects this may also include individuals with other degrees at the masters and baccalaureate levels.</p>
