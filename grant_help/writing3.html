			<h3>The Grant Writing Process - Peer Review</h3>
            <p><strong>The NIH Peer Review Process Revised - Streamlining</strong></p>
            <p>To respond effectively to an increasing number of grant applications, NIH has designed, evaluated, and implemented a new strategy for the peer review of grants known as "streamlining."</p>
            <p>Streamlining is a procedure that basically sorts the grant applications assigned to an initial review group (IRG)/study section into one of two categories: 1) scored applications (applications assigned priority scores ranging from 100 (most meritorious) to 500 (least meritorious), and 2) unscored applications (formerly called "disapprovals"). The format that incorporates reviewers' critiques, essentially unaltered, into the summary statement. The funding mechanisms included in the streamlining process include: investigator-initiated research project grants, R01, R03, R21, R25, R29, and PO1. Other funding mechanisms may be involved in the triage process, such as individual fellowships (F), research training (T32), research scientist career development (K), or center grant applications (P50). For a discussion of funding mechanisms, refer to the Information System.</p>
            <p>A call to an Institute Project Officer or Scientific Review Administrator (SRA) prior to developing an application may provide a valuable insight into the review process. Armed with this knowledge, an applicant can prepare an application that best meets the priorities of the Institute and expectations of the peer reviewers. For additional information on the types of funding mechanisms, NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, and other important Internet-based grant information, refer to the Information System.</p>
            <p>For non-streamlined applications, the full range of scores (100 to 500) and the Not Recommended for Further consideration (NRFC) designation are to be used as in previous reviews. However, a streamlined summary statement will be prepared for all mechanisms. Although the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts notice references streamlining for approximately half of the applications, actual experience suggests that one-third of the applications resulted in referral to the streamlining process. Therefore, under the new review policy, reviewers are being asked to agree on approximately one- third of the application assigned to their study section as "noncompetitive".</p>
            <p>NIH believes that the streamlining process can enhance the review system in several substantial ways:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><p>Only those applications judged as "competitive" are discussed at the study section meeting. Since it is intended that approximately one-third of the applications will be placed in the non-competitive category, there is ample time for in-depth discussion for each competitive application.</p></li>
                <li><p>In some instances, the streamlining process has resulted in shorter study section meetings.</p></li>
                <li><p>Assigned reviewers are instructed to prepare only the written critique section for both competitive and noncompetitive applications.</p></li>
                <li><p>Assigned reviewers are encouraged to focus written critiques of noncompetitive applications primarily on major strengths and weaknesses, issues, and concerns. NIH found that this process provided applicants with a better understanding of the major concerns they must address in preparing a revised application.</p></li>
         	</ul>
            <p>Issues related to human subjects protection, animal welfare, and gender and ethnic minority representation in human subjects research still needs to be addressed, whether applications are determined to be noncompetitive or are scored as competitive.</p>
            <p>Noncompetitive applications are those which reviewers believe represent qualitatively the bottom third of research customarily reviewed in their study section. To carry out the streamlining process most effectively, the noncompetitive status of an application must be determined prior to the study section meeting (the peer reviewers). The procedure is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
    				<li><p>By a predetermined date prior to the study section meeting, all study section members are asked to identify to the SRA any of their assigned applications that they believe should be designated noncompetitive.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A few days prior to the study section meeting, all study section members receive a list from the SRA of those application proposed by at least two assigned reviewers to be designated noncompetitive. This list is considered final pending only confirmation at the outset of the study section meeting, unless one or more study section members do not concur with the noncompetitive status of an applications and so notify the SRA. Such notification will cause that application to be considered competitive and brought to full review at the meeting.</p></li>
                    <li><p>At the beginning of the meeting, the list of noncompetitive applications is read aloud for final concurrence by the entire study section. Even at that time, nonconcurrence by only one study section member is sufficient to consider the application competitive and bring it to full review at the meeting. Occasionally, it may also happen that study section members will unanimously agree at the outset of the meeting to designate additional applications as noncompetitive.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Applications may also be designated noncompetitive during the full review process at the study section meeting. Determination that an application is noncompetitive occurs when discussion of the merits of an application leads reviewers to agree that an application should be placed in the bottom third (i.e., noncompetitive). As with other applications designated noncompetitive earlier in the review process the resultant summary statements will not include the "Resume and Summary of Discussion" section.</p></li>
                    <li><p>For those applications that are scored (i.e., are considered competitive), reviewers are expected to modify their critiques appropriately during the discussion that occurs at the meeting, removing, for example, criticisms that are negated through discussion among reviewers. Otherwise, the reviewers' critique will be included in the summary statement essentially unaltered by the SRA. The SRA will prepare a resume of the discussion for scored applications.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The full range of priority scores is not used for competitive applications. Logically, if one-third of the applications are considered noncompetitive, no scores should be given below that score which equates to the study section, 66th percentile. To implement this system most efficiently, then, the SRA must obtain reviewer's initial judgements on all assigned applications by fax prior to the start of the meeting and compare them with the judgment of other reviewers so that a proposed list of noncompetitive applications can be compiled. The SRA will compile a list of all applications proposed by at least two reviewers to be noncompetitive and provide this list by e-mail or fax to the entire study section membership, with a request for any expressions of non-concurrence to be communicated by a specified date. To prevent breaches in confidentiality, faxing or e-mailing should be done using grant application number only, rather than PI names. If, after seeing the list of proposed noncompetitive applications, any study section member wants to move an application to the competitive category, they may do so whether they are an assigned review or not. These designations are discussed at the outset of each study section meeting and competitive or noncompetitive status confirmed by the full committee. Reviewers will continue to use their independent judgment. If there is doubt in a reviewer's mind about a particular application, NIH believes it is preferable to err on the side of inclusion in the competitive category rather than the noncompetitive. Conflict of interest polices remain unchanged in the streamlining procedure.</p></li>
                  </ol>
                   <p>Contact with an Institute Project Officer early in the grant development process is one method for increasing the probability that an application will be selected as competitive and awarded a meritorious priority score leading to funding. Project Officers can provide an applicant with the latest information on funding priorities, program announcements, and other information critical to the success of your proposal. Other important contacts at NIH are the SRAs, who can provide insight into the peer review process and the history and membership of various IRGs. When technical concerns arise regarding what is allowable under the Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines (budget items or administrative policies), a Grants Management Specialist can provide a wealth of information that will ensure that your application is inline with the policies and regulations of the PHS and the NIH. Such action will reduce the likelihood that an otherwise fundable proposal falls short because of easily correctable technical and/or administrative errors.</p>
                    <p>Prospective applicants should be familiar with the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts, the NIH home page and other useful home pages on the web, and information on accessing appropriate program and review staff within the NIH Institutes. Such information and access is critical in a dynamic system that is changing the nature of the review process, the application forms (i.e., PHS 398 and 2590), priorities, and regulations. While scientific training and experience are important elements of securing funding, an in-depth knowledge of the process of submission, review, and administration can be of equal importance.</p>
