        <h2>Step-By-Step Grant Help</h2>
        	<h3>The Grant Writing Process - Writing Glossary</h3>
            	<p><strong>Visuals for Emphasis</strong><br /> One reason for using visuals in a written document is to emphasize facts, ideas, or trends. Often, this emphasis is placed on things that are measurable.</p>
                <p><strong>Visuals for Clarity</strong><br /> A second reason for incorporating visuals or graphics into a text would be to achieve clarity. Ideas may be clear to a researcher writer but totally obscure to a evaluator for a number of possible reasons. In order to understand a grant application, the reader must not only decode the text but also in some sense see things from the writer's perspective. This is especially true when the material is somewhat complex to the reader.</p>
               <p><strong>Visuals for Condensing</strong><br /> A third reason for using visuals to supplement a text is to condense information. When presenting statistical information, researchers often find that words are inadequate for presenting data, and in fact sometimes get in the way. Condensing information through the use of visuals can be accomplished in a variety of ways but most commonly through the use of tables.</p>
               <p><strong>Visuals for Comparing</strong><br /> A fourth way of supplementing a text with visual aids is to use them to make sharp and vivid comparisons. A table, for example, may make comparisons possible for readers, but they must make these comparisons themselves. What is needed, then, to make a more graphic comparisons between variables or quantities is the use of charts.</p>
              <p><strong>Visuals for Illustration</strong><br /> A fifth use of visuals in a written text is to illustrate facts, ideas, or processes. In this sense, the visual itself conveys information and provides a basis for comparison.</p>
              <p><strong>Constructing Line Graphs</strong><br /> When constructing line graphs it is important to keep in mind a sense of proportion when scaling the "X" and "Y" coordinates. Roughly the trends reflected in the line graph should correspond to the actual changes over time. If the time line (usually the horizontal one) is not in proportion to the vertical scale, then the actual trends or changes can be distorted.</p>
              <p>A second tip on creating effective line graphs is to keep multiple lines in a graph easily distinguishable. If the plotting of the two variables seems too close to achieve clarity and distinction between the lines, then it may be best to make a larger graph, use more divisions on the X and Y axes, or sometimes even use two graphs instead of one.</p>
              <p>A final tip for effective graph making is to be selective over when to use grid lines versus tick marks. Generally, these tick marks (denoting the scale of a particular coordinate) are sufficient to show trends but if a measurable graph for reference is necessary, or if a great deal of closely related variables are used, then a grided graph may be best.</p>
              <p><strong>Constructing Tables</strong><br /> When constructing tables, make sure that the columns and rows neatly line up and are labeled in a way that is easily distinguishable from the information presented. Grid line are sometimes helpful here. Finally, always label the table exactly as it referenced in the text.</p>
              <p><strong>Constructing Pie Charts</strong><br /> A pie chart shows one relationship, that of part-to-whole. The pie represents 100% of some quantity, with its parts being some percentage of the total. To construct effective pie charts the researcher must above try to achieve clarity. For example, the lines, divisions, and labels must be clear and crisp. This means that if the labeling with anyone of the slices appears to be cramped, then it should be placed outside the pie with a pointer as in example above. If any one slice of the pie is to be emphasized, then it can be easily set apart from the pie.</p>
              <p><strong>Constructing Bar Charts</strong><br /> Unlike part-to-whole situations, when comparisons between two or more quantities must be made a bar chart often works best. Such charts are most often used when comparing data or information over a period of time. There are, however, several variations of bar charts possible, depending on the application. The simplest bar chart contains only one variable. A more complex bar chart contains more than one variable. And the most complex type of bar chart is one that is multi-variate (has more than one variable) but has all of the variables represented in a single bar.</p>
              <p>Bar charts can be produced vertically or horizontally, but most are vertical when the time line is horizontal. Generally the individual bars are shaded in to add to their distinction. In cases where multiple variables are represented in a single bar, it becomes necessary to shade a bar according to the variables within it. The easiest way to achieve such distinctions, especially when multi-colored print is unavailable, is to use different line configurations within the bars.</p>
              <p><strong>Other Type of Charts</strong><br /> Another popular kind of illustration in grant preparation is the hierarchy chart, graphically depicting a set of objects and sub-objects. In other applications a flow or process chart showing direction or movement may be necessary.</p>
              <p>It should not be thought, however, that all charts must show direction or a sequence in time. Illustrations can also show generally the relationship of parts to each other. When using flow or process charts, be careful to avoid an excessive amount of detail. Remember it is the reflection of direction, flow, or movement that is intended; such illustration should never be seen as a substitute for a thorough discussion of relationships or change within a system.</p>
              <p><strong>Placement Of Graphics Or Visuals</strong></p>
              <p>All visuals or graphic aids can be placed either in the text or appended to it in some reasonable way. Determining exact placement, however, requires a careful consideration of the visuals' importance and size. If the visual is crucial to the understanding of the text, and of a page or less in size, then it should be placed within the text, keeping the reader from having to hunt for it in an appendix.</p>
              <p>Exact placement within the text should be as close as possible to where it is referenced, but at an appropriate breaking point, say at the end of a paragraph or section. If the visual takes up two or more pages, then its very size means that it would abruptly break up the text if placed within it, and therefore more aptly belongs in an appendix. But be careful not to put important graphical information in an appendix only to observe the 20-page grant application requirement.</p>
              <p>Finally, despite their placement, all visuals should be referenced in the text, labeled exactly as they are referenced, and be of a size that is consistent with the margins maintained throughout the rest of the text. Nothing sticks out more like a sore thumb than a visual that is either too small to make sense of, or too large in proportion to be taken seriously as an intended supplement to the text.</p>
              <p><strong>Devices of Transition</strong><br /> Transitions are "connective tissues," so to speak, that tie ideas together. The following transitional devices can be inserted at the revision stage (if they are not already present) when the grant applicant is:</p>
              <p>Starting a discussion</p>
              <p>—first of all, first, in the first place, initially</p>
              <p>Adding a point</p>
              <p>—next, second, third, further, furthermore, moreover, also, and, in the second place</p>
              <p>Giving an example</p>
              <p>—for example, for instance, occasionally, specifically, in particular, in general</p>
              <p>Making a comparison</p>
              <p>—similarly, likewise, at the same time, in the same way</p>
              <p>Making a contrast</p>
              <p>—but, however, yet, or nevertheless, whereas, on the contrary, on the other hand</p>
              <p>Conceding a point</p>
              <p>—doubtless, granted that,</p>
              <p>Repeating for emphasis</p>
              <p>—again, in other words, above (before), once again</p>
              <p>Presenting results</p>
              <p>—then, therefore, thus, hence, so, consequently, as a result</p>
              <p>Drawing conclusions</p>
              <p>—finally, in conclusion, to sum up, in short, therefore, so</p>
              <p><strong>Pronouns</strong><br /> Pronouns make thoughts connect by serving as noun substitutes. That is, they replace and refer to nouns. Types of pronouns that are particularly helpful in establishing connections between ideas and sentences include Personal Pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they; me, him, her, us, them; my, mine, your, yours, his, her, hers, its, ours, their, theirs); Relative Pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, and that); and Demonstrative Pronouns (this, that, these, and those).</p>
              <p>When the researcher revises a grant application, he or she can increase coherence and decrease needless repetition by using pronouns to replace recurring nouns. Of course, the applicant must be aware of the rules and guidelines of pronoun use in the following areas:</p>
              <ol>
              	<li>sexist language</li>
                <li>pronoun case</li>
                <li>pronoun</li>
                <li>pronoun reference</li>
             </ol>
             <p><strong>Key Words and Phrases</strong><br /> A final technique for ensuring coherence is repeating a discussion's key words and phrases either in their original form or with synonyms. However, researchers have to be judicious when checking for repeated words and phrases, since too much repetition spoils coherence.</p>
             <p><strong>Active Verbs</strong></p>
             <p>By active, we mean active voice, or when the subject does the acting in a sentence. By passive, we mean passive voice, or when the subject of the sentence is acted upon by something or someone. The following sentence, written in passive voice, is weak and not as concise as it might be.</p>
             <p><em>The application was passed by the IRG members.</em></p>
             <p>Contrast the above sentence with the following direct, forceful version written in the active voice.</p>
             <p><em>The IRG members passed the application.</em></p>
             <p>With the second version, the proper relationship between the actor (subject) and what is acted upon is established, so the author's intent is clearer.</p>
             <p>Concise Language</p>
             <p>Conciseness is an important language consideration for researchers for two reasons:</p>
				<ul>
                	<li>it is required by the strictly enforced 20-page limit of all grant applications; and</li>
                    <li>it satisfies the needs of busy grant application reviewers.</li>
               </ul>
            <p>Yet, given these constraints, researchers always lament that they often cannot condense their ideas into the limits allowed. In part, this results from the fact that grant applications sometimes go in without the proper amount of internal review and editing. Even when grammar/style checking programs are used, which indicate general wordiness within the grant application, often they do supply a vehicle for improvement beyond suggestions at rephrasing. Given this situation, we offer a tried-and-true method for paring down scientific prose into its most meaningful components, a technique called "Key-word Editing."</p>
            <p><strong>Key Word Editing</strong></p>
            <p>Essentially, key word editing involves four simple steps:</p>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Read the grant application text closely and highlight each significant word or phrase that is essential to an overall understanding of the material.</li>
                    <li>Go back over the highlighted words and extract the kernel idea within each sentence. (Boxing-in of underlined/highlighted words works well)</li>
                    <li>Taking the kernel ideas from each sentence and using some, but not all, of the highlighted material for concrete detail, reconstruct new sentences around the key ideas that capture more succinctly the ideas being conveyed.</li>
                    <li>Edit the newly constructed sentences for coherence and transition. Followed carefully, these four steps can reduce prose passages in volume by as much as 40% since they force researchers to re-think what they are trying to say, often requiring them to find a new means of expression throughout. In contrast, if a researcher simply re-reads over and over again a section of the grant application, but never takes the time to re-cast what is being said, chances are conciseness will only be improved by 5-10%, since the original phrasing that was used forces certain unavoidable sentence construction patterns.</li>
              </ul>
          <p><strong>Clear, Precise Language</strong><br /> Even for specialists writing to other specialists in their own field, the rule of thumb these days is never use a long word when a short one will do. They are encouraged to avoid technicalese whenever possible. What does this dictum mean, practically speaking? Besides testing word choices for clarity and comprehensibility to as wide an audience as possible, using clear, precise language means avoiding the three pitfalls of technical writing today:</p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Verb ed nouns</li>
            <li>Nouned verbs</li>
            <li>Noun strings</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Politicians, military strategists, and, unfortunately, researchers love to transform nouns into verbs, resulting in a new strain of verbed nouns and often inaccurate usage. For instance, a popular verb in business and government writing these days is to impact, as in "This project will impact further study in this area." Someone not attuned to its current metamorphosis from a noun meaning "a forceful contact or collision" or "a compelling effect" to a verb meaning "to have an important effect on" may be momentarily confused.</p>
         <p>Researchers should also be beware of turning verbs into nouns simply to sound more formal or impressive. The result can also be nouned verbs, which are confusing, as well as effusive.</p>
         <p>Researchers should also avoid a third pitfall found in many grant applications, known as the noun string. Often, professional usage pressures the writer into lining up a series of nouns in an almost indecipherable unit. Aside from being awkward reading, noun strings pose problems for readers who need to understand what is being said.</p>
         <p>Appropriate Sentence Length Material that has to be digested by busy and often cursory readers should be of the appropriate sentence length. It should not contain long, overly subordinated sentences The most readable length for sentences in routine business letters and memos, for instance, is approximately 20 words. In grant applications, because of the need for elaboration in most instances, it is sometimes difficult to limit sentence lengths to 20 words, so a range of 20 to 30 words for sentences is recommended.</p>
         <p>Writing sentences of readable length does not, of course, entail writing "primer style" sentences, or sentences that are constructed without subordination and that are abrupt sounding. The following sentences, for instance, are written in "primer style." Note how abrupt the transition is between them. Then observe how they can be combined to form a more readable, yet not ponderously long, alternative.</p>
         <p><em>Example:</em></p>
         <p>Production research is focused on developing technology. This technology will permit safe, efficient recovery of oil and gas from frontier areas. These areas are the Arctic and the deep ocean.</p>
         <p><em>Combined Alternative:</em></p>
         <p>Production research is focused on developing technology that will permit safe, efficient recovery of oil and gas from frontier areas such as the Arctic or the deep ocean.</p>
         <p><strong>Revising for Correctness</strong><br /> Experienced grant writers are sometimes hired because they know the conventions of written language: proper punctuation, grammar, mechanics, spelling, and usage. If a grant application is not thoroughly edited for errors in these areas and if such errors are eventually "caught" by discerning reviewers, often the writer, the technician, and the organization responsible for the document end up looking bad. Critics find it too easy to impugn the quality of a written work on the basis of a faulty subject-verb agreement, improper use of apostrophes, or an incorrect spelling. So it is important for writers to grow to recognize their shortcomings when it comes to such language conventions.</p>
         <p>It is not our purpose here to explore fully all of the rules of language and editing. Rather, a Checklist for Readability and Correctness has been included. Added to the Reconsiderations Checklist given earlier, it offers a full range of language considerations.</p>
         <p><strong>Heuristic</strong></p>
         	<ol>
            	<li>Identify all potential audiences using the list of audiences cited above.</li>
                <li>Classify the audiences according to priority, often targeting peer reviewers and key institute officials as the key readers.</li>
                <li>Explore the following categories that pertain to audiences to get a better sense of who your readers are and what their expectations might be. Define your audiences in terms of:</li>
           </ol>
   			<ul>
            	<li>BACKGROUND (include education, experience, and familiarity with your proposed research)</li>
                <li>ROLE (include title/position, duties/responsibilities, and functions with respect to your research proposal)</li>
                <li>ATTITUDE (include biases, special interests, and perspective)</li>
            </ul>
         <p><strong>Program Directors</strong></p>
         <p><em>EXPECTATIONS/RESPONSIBILITIES:</em></p>
         <p>Program directors may request that you develop a preproposal and will expect to see a brief description of your research question(s); a statement regarding the significance of the proposed research; proposed data collection and sampling strategies; analysis plans; and preliminary budget and key personnel. This document should provide sufficient detail to allow the program director to determine: 1) if the topic would be of interest to the funding institute; 2) if the proposed approach is sufficiently robust to insure reliable data; 3) the feasibility of the project; 4) if the budget is reasonable; and, 5) that the experience of the research team is appropriate.</p>
         <p><em>QUALIFICATIONS:</em></p>
         <p>Program Directors, in general, have earned a Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degree, are knowledgeable in their area of assignment, and are expected to develop national programs of research based on a review of their assigned fields.</p>
         <p><em>BASIS FOR DECISION-MAKING:</em></p>
         <p>Program Directors base their decisions on the recommendations of the Peer Review Committee and the National Advisory Council, the potential contribution of the proposed project, the funding institute's priorities, and the unique aspects of your project. They also consider the number of currently funded projects that are examining the same or similar questions, and the availability of funds.</p>

         <p><em>EXPECTATIONS/RESPONSIBILITIES:</em></p>
         <p>Division of Research Grants staff will examine the application for the purpose of determining institute assignments. Based on information you provide on the face pages and the body of the application, staff will match your request with NIH programs priorities. Assignments are based on the nature of your request. For example, studies aimed at treating nicotine addiction are likely to be assigned to NIDA while studies aimed at reducing lung cancer associated with smoking will be assigned to the National Cancer Institute.</p>
         <p>Failure to indicate the specific Institute and its grants program and/or to provide sufficient detail in the body of the proposal may result in a less than optimal assignment for staff members.</p>
         <p><em>QUALIFICATIONS:</em></p>
         <p>Division of Research Grants Staff, in general, have earned graduate degrees, have some knowledge of research, and have expert knowledge of the assignment process and NIH priorities.</p>
         <p><em>BASIS FOR DECISION-MAKING:</em></p>
