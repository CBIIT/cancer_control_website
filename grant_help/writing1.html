        <h3>How Good Are Your Research Skills?</h3>
        <a name="a1" id="a1"></a>
        <dl>
          <dt> <strong><em>1. Have you completed a Ph.D. or equivalent degree with a research emphasis?</em></strong></dt>
        </dl>
        <p>Most R01 grant recipients hold a Ph.D. or equivalent degree. If you   do not hold this expected degree, then greater justification will be   required to show how you might qualify as a scientist and research   administrator.</p>
        <a name="a2" id="a2"></a>
        <p><strong><em>2. Do you belong to any scientific societies?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Membership in scientific societies suggests a current understanding of research  and  scholarship.  Peer review committee members may also infer from your  active membership in these groups that you are well-informed on topics of  current interest that relate both to your career and your grant application.</p>
        <a name="a3" id="a3"></a>
        <p><strong><em>3. Can you identify 10 principal researchers in your research field?</em></strong></p>
        <p>If you cannot name 10 relevant figures in your research field, this suggests that  you may lack the requisite knowledge to construct significant research  questions and appropriate designs within the context of the field.</p>
        <a name="a4" id="a4"></a>
        <p><strong><em>4. Have you presented original research to peers at a national scientific conference?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Participation in national conferences suggests that you are familiar with the  work of other  scholars who share your research interests; have presented your  own work to your peers and/or served as a discussant on relevant panels, and  are an active member of a particular  scholarly community.</p>
        <a name="a5" id="a5"></a>
        <p><strong><em>5. Have you received scholarships, grants, or awards for research training or research development?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Prior funding in this area, especially if it was awarded competitively, is likely to  increase your chances of NIH funding because it reveals that you have the  level of education and experience to conduct scholarly research.    Non-peer reviewed funding, such as scholarships and honors, also serve to  demonstrate your commitment to and expertise in the research arena.</p>
        <a name="a6" id="a6"></a>
        <p><strong><em>6. Have you ever supervised research assistants?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Your role as an educator and administrator may prove important in certain  types of granting situations and suggests a greater overall experience and  competence needed to complete the proposed research successfully.</p>
        <a name="a7" id="a7"></a>
        <p><strong><em>7. Can you identify four or more refereed journals in your research field?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Knowledge of articles appearing in refereed journals will help to demonstrate  the relevant background and significance of your proposed research. The  peer review committee may also assume that you will publish the findings of  your research and will thus be looking for evidence of your informed  perspective.</p>
        <a name="a8" id="a8"></a>
        <p><strong><em>8. Have you published in a refereed journal in the past 5 years?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Most grantees are expected to have published recently in peer refereed  journals. This is one indication that you are not only likely to be competitive, but  also suggests that you will continue to share your work publicly.</p>
        <a name="a9" id="a9"></a>
        <p><strong><em>9. Were you the senior author of a scientific article?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Rank in authorship suggests a relative importance of your research ability and  your demonstrates your willingness to work with others. Peer review groups are  looking for demonstrated success and ability.</p>
        <a name="a10" id="a10"></a>
        <p><strong><em>10. Have you received peer review grant support in the past?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Prior research awards from organizations that employ a peer review  mechanism to determine scientific acceptability (for example, PHS fellowships,  small grants and career awards; foundation support; and/or State or institution  grants) have a positive impact on NIH Initial Review Group (IRG) members.   It is important that you list any participation you may have either as the direct  recipient of such an award or as a member of a research team.  Peer reviewers generally assume that you will be more competitive if you have  already competed successfully for grant support. This impression is further  strengthen, if you have published the results of such efforts.</p>
        <a name="a11" id="a11"></a>
        <p><strong><em>11. Have you served as a key member of a research team?</em></strong></p>
        <p>If you have served as key member of a research team, then you are better  prepared to accomplish the proposed work, meet agency reporting  requirements, manage a research team, and produce reliable research results.</p>
        <a name="a12" id="a12"></a>
        <p><strong><em>12. Have you been involved in the development of grant applications?</em></strong></p>
        <p>If you have developed a grant application before, then you have a basis for  developing more competitive proposals.  You should review your prior  experience in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of earlier proposals; all  weaknesses should be carefully addressed.  Colleagues should be consulted for informal review of all subsequent  proposals.</p>
        <a name="a13" id="a13"></a>
        <p><strong><em>13. Do you feel capable of evaluating your own research work?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The ability to be self critical is essential, not only to the quality of the grant  application you submit, but also to ensure a greater degree of thoughtfulness  and thoroughness in your work.</p>
        <a name="a14" id="a14"></a>
        <p><strong><em>14. Are you familiar with statistical software (e.g., SPSS, SAS, BMDP)?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Your education and experience should have acquainted you with a number  of tools that are indispensable for research. Among these are statistical tools. </p>
        <a name="a15" id="a15"></a>
        <p><strong><em>15. Can you develop a persuasive argument?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Your grant application must be a carefully crafted document that will capture  the peer reviewers attention demonstrating your thoughtfulness and skill in  presenting a readable, comprehensive science plan that, if funded, will result in  a worthwhile contribution to your field.  You must demonstrate your enthusiasm for the proposed research, the  significance of the work to the field, and the power of your design to provide  reliable data. </p>
        <a name="a16" id="a16"></a>
        <p><strong><em>16. Can you demonstrate you ability to manage a research project?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Management skills are critical, especially when they are considered in the  context of your proposed research design. You must be able to demonstrate  your ability to select and manage key personnel, hire consultants, administer a  consortium arrangement, respond to agency requirements, monitor the  budget, and conduct all aspects of the proposed science.</p>

        <h3>Do You Have the Resources to Apply for a Grant?</h3>
        <a name="b1" id="b1"></a>
        <p><strong><em>1. Do you know how to notify your institutional administrators responsible for grant-management issues?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Most institutions offer some degree of grants activity support, yet surprisingly  many new researchers are not aware of this support. You will need to know  not only the process for review of human subjects, animal welfare, bio-safety,  or bio-hazard protection issues, but also the sign-off and budget management  procedures at your institution.</p>
        <a name="b2" id="b2"></a>
        <p><strong><em>2. Do you know how to notify the IRB (Human Subjects / Animal Welfare) committee at your institution? </em></strong></p>
        <p>Your full understanding of the IRB Committee (Internal Review Board) and how  it functions is critical. When used properly, the IRB will ensure that you are in  compliance with protection regulations regarding research subjects or  procedures and can also provide a first-level test of your idea before it  leaves your institution.</p>
        <a name="b3" id="b3"></a>
        <p><strong><em>3. Have you identified external resources necessary to support the development of  a research application?</em></strong></p>
        <p>You should be fully aware of all possible avenues of support before you  actually submit your application to an agency. By doing so, you will not only  increase your chances of getting funded, but direct your proposal to the most  appropriate funding agency. </p>
        <a name="b4" id="b4"></a>
        <p><strong><em>4. Have you prepared a human consent form?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The use of human subjects in a research design requires that the researcher  provide full and open disclosure of all possible risks to the health, welfare, or  legal standing of the participant.  Researchers should be aware of PHS requirements for the protection of human  subjects. Failure to provide such assurance can lead to an unfundable proposal. </p>
        <a name="b5" id="b5"></a>
        <p><strong><em>5. Have you analyzed space, computing needs, and availability? </em></strong></p>
        <p>You should develop a list of required resources, such as office or lab space,  equipment including computers and office furniture, transportation, personnel,  etc.    Answering some of the following questions may prove helpful:   Have you identified colleagues who will serve as informal reviewers of your  draft proposal?  Have you located secretarial support for the development of a  publication quality application?  If you are proposing to use specific software tools, have you a clear  understanding of the benefits and limitations of these tools?  Have you negotiated for space and equipment with your administrator?</p>
        <a name="b6" id="b6"></a>
        <p><strong><em>6. Are you aware of your institutional sign-off procedures?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Knowledge of the sign-off procedure is critical because it demonstrates your  level of awareness about the strengths and limitation of your own institution.   Armed with this knowledge you can begin to develop a timeline with critical  dates for IRB and budget review, receipt of support letters from collaborators  or consultants, completion of final draft for informal review, and,  submission to the funding agency.</p>
        <a name="b7" id="b7"></a>
        <p><strong><em>7. Can you identify personnel who are likely to contribute to your grant application?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Determining key personnel resources and support staff is your responsibility, and  your ability to manage this team will affect the overall competitiveness of your  grant application. </p>
        <a name="b8" id="b8"></a>
        <p><strong><em>8. Is your institution going to give you the backing (e.g., in-kind or cost-sharing contributions) for your proposed research?</em></strong></p>
        <p>When institutional backing is absent or not demonstrated, you will greatly  diminish your chances for getting funded, since the review committee will most  likely conclude that poor institutional support inevitably leads to limited  research success.</p>
        <a name="b9" id="b9"></a>
        <p><strong><em>9. Can you negotiate time away from teaching obligations?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Release time from teaching usually means full institutional support for your  proposed research.  It also demonstrates a commitment on your part to argue  strongly for the importance of your research to the institution's mission.</p>
        <a name="b10" id="b10"></a>
        <p><strong><em>10. Can you determine costs (e.g., level of effort, subject costs) associated with the proposed research?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The more clearly and convincingly you can cost out your proposed research  with justifications, the better your chances of getting funded. You need to  remember that you are being judged by experienced grantees who have  constructed many budgets and subsequently conducted research within the  confines of these budgets.</p>

        <p>Variables must be correctly identified in the body of the proposal. </p>
        <a name="c2" id="c2"></a>
        <p><strong><em>2. Will you use standardized data collection instruments?</em></strong></p>
        <p>If yes, what instruments are you planning to use and on what basis   were they  selected?  If no, have you reviewed the thousands of well-validated   data-collection instruments and are your reasons for not selecting any   of these well grounded? </p>
        <a name="c3" id="c3"></a>
        <p><strong><em>3. Are you going to create a new scale or measure?</em></strong></p>
        <p>New investigators should avoid the development of new scales.  Given the  number of validated instruments, the risks involved in the development of new  instruments, and the advanced level of experience required to develop new  instruments, it is recommended that the use of existing instruments be carefully  considered.  Should your design require the development of a new data-collection  instrument, you should seek a Co-Principal Investigator with the requisite  experience. </p>
        <a name="c4" id="c4"></a>
        <p><strong><em>4. Do you have proven access to your subject population?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Failure to secure proven access to your proposed research population will  negatively effect your funding potential.  Letters attached to the application  from the those who have the authority (e.g., school principals hospital  administrators, prison administrators, and clinic directors) to grant you access to  the required subjects is recommended. </p>
        <a name="c5" id="c5"></a>
        <p><strong><em>5. Is the estimated duration of your proposed research realistic?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Have you carefully considered the amount of time it will take to recruit key  personnel; train data-collection personnel; collect data, deliver interventions;  clean, code and enter data; and begin analysis?  You should consider the  development of a timeline containing critical points in the research process.    You should discuss this timeline with more experienced investigators who can help  strengthen your projections. </p>
        <a name="c6" id="c6"></a>
        <p><strong><em>6. Is your research question(s) clearly stated?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Develop a clearly articulated statement regarding your research question(s).</p>
        <a name="c7" id="c7"></a>
        <p><strong><em>7. Is your sample size(s) adequate?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Have you carefully considered the size of your sample and have you considered  recruitment, non-compliance, retention, and related issues and the effect on  sample size?  Have you considered using a Power Calculation to determine the  appropriate sample size?   Conversely, is your sample so large as to increase the cost of the study and  place at potential risk more subjects than would be required to produce a  statistically significant outcome. </p>
        <a name="c8" id="c8"></a>
        <p><strong><em>8. Are your inclusion criteria adequate?</em></strong></p>
        <p>When designing your sampling strategy, have you carefully constructed the  criteria for inclusion such that those entering into the study are appropriate to  your design?  Are the requirements so stringent that obtaining an adequate  number will be too difficult? </p>
        <a name="c9" id="c9"></a>
        <p><strong><em>9. Have you identified any potential risk to subjects participating in your research?</em></strong></p>
        <p>A critical element in the development of your research proposal is the  consideration of potential risk to subjects participating in the study.  All efforts  must be taken to reduce potential risks and an informed consent form should  be prepared according to the PHS guidelines. </p>
        <a name="c10" id="c10"></a>
        <p><strong><em>10. Does the geographic location of your research matter?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Have you considered the effects of region or location on your research?  Will  research results be effected by the geographic setting?  And have you  provided a discussion of potential effects?</p>
        <a name="c11" id="c11"></a>
        <p><strong><em>11. Will the data derived from this research experience be published?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Since the publication of your research results is a critical step in the scientific  process, have you identified potential journals and have you contacted journal  editors for publication instruction and interest?  Have you created a schedule for  the development of publications and have authorship considerations been  discussed with key members of the research team?</p>
        <a name="c12" id="c12"></a>
        <p><strong><em>12. Could you defend your research design?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Your research design should be based on the nature of your research  question(s) and the aim(s) of the proposed work.  If other designs are likely to  provide reliable data, why have you selected this particular approach?  How  does it differ from other options?  What are its strengths relative to the  other  strategies?  And are all aspects of the design in agreement with each other? </p>

        <h3>How Significant Is Your Research?</h3>
        <a name="d1" id="d1"></a>
        <p><strong><em>1. Will your research lay the foundation for future work?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The aim of your research should be to push forward the knowledge in your  research discipline. Peer reviewers must be able to see the significance of the  work you are proposing and the power of the design to produce reliable  results that will result in scientific articles.   Thus, peer reviewers look for proposed work that extends the knowledge base,  makes contributions to a particular discipline, and is of utility to the funding  agency.</p>
        <a name="d2" id="d2"></a>
        <p><strong><em>2. Is this research central to your career?</em></strong></p>
        <p>To be successful in getting a grant award, your proposed research must be  central to your training, experience, and career interests. Otherwise, you  suggest that you are perhaps &quot;chasing research dollars&quot; rather than pushing  forward the boundaries of your field.    Also when you suggest that you are working somewhat afield from your  experience, then greater justification must be provided in the body of the  application. In some instances, you may need to find a Co-Principal  Investigator who has the requisite credentials in the proposed research area.</p>
        <a name="d3" id="d3"></a>
        <p><strong><em>3. Will your research make a significant contribution to your field?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The degree of significance your proposed research will have greatly plays into  the fundability of your project. For example, replication studies may be safer,  but they tend to leave peer reviewers with less enthusiasm than they might  have for more original work.    Moreover, the proposal must address the mission of the funding institution; that  is, the results of your work should provide answers to questions of interest to the  funding source. </p>
        <a name="d4" id="d4"></a>
        <p><strong><em>4. Can you state the distinctive/unique aspect(s) about your research idea?</em></strong></p>
        <p>To be successful in getting a grant award, your proposed work must stand out  as distinctive or unique. This is sometimes difficult if you're proposing a replication  study. However, even here you should point out how your work is extends  previous efforts. For example, one of your methods may differ from prior work --  this difference and its possible contribution should be made clear in the body  of your proposal.</p>
        <a name="d5" id="d5"></a>
        <p><strong><em>5. Does your research fit into a larger research/scientific context?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The research context includes prior work that you and your colleagues have  done in the proposed research area. It also includes published articles and  books that outline theoretical positions.  Together these entities form a broad  research context within which you are likely to be judged.  If your work falls  outside this research context, then greater justification is required on your part.</p>
        <a name="d6" id="d6"></a>
        <p><strong><em>6. Will your research lead to new knowledge or an original contribution?</em></strong></p>
        <p>New knowledge can be considered an original contribution to your research  field. It is often reflected in peer reviewed articles and presentations in national  conferences. If your proposed research does not speak to the potential for  contributions of new knowledge, then your priority scores may be adversely  affected.</p>
        <a name="d7" id="d7"></a>
        <p><strong><em>7. Are the tools/methods/resources you have selected likely to contribute  to the quality of your research?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The questions, tools, methods, and resources must all be carefully matched to  insure that each is appropriate and that each is interconnected to other  aspects of the proposal. For example, an inappropriate data collection  instrument or methodology may totally discredit your research idea.    In other instances, you may have a very sound proposal, but lack the  personal or institutional resources to carry out the proposed work, leaving you  again in an unfundable position. </p>
        <a name="d8" id="d8"></a>
        <p><strong><em>8. Does your research show evidence of building on prior experience/theories?</em></strong></p>
        <p>By building on prior experience or theories, you not only suggest that you are  current in your field but that you will not be beginning your research in isolation  from other scientists working in your area. Such research requires a through  knowledge of the field; the ability to interpret the results of other work and the  expertise to derive new questions, approaches, or methods.</p>
        <a name="d9" id="d9"></a>
        <p><strong><em>9. Is the proposed research timely?</em></strong></p>
        <p>This question is related to the earlier question of &quot;new knowledge,&quot; but here the  issue is the timeliness of proposed research. Timeliness is often, but not always,  defined by the institute's agenda as stated in its grants announcements. But  timeliness can also be dictated by the research field, especially when new  theories and/or methods are prevalent. In either case you must address how  timely your proposal is and define its expected impact. </p>
        <a name="d10" id="d10"></a>
        <p><strong><em>10. Will your research result in publication within the next year?</em></strong></p>
        <p>This question addresses the issues of currency and outcome. If you cannot  demonstrate that your work is likely to be reflected in publications and  presentations, then you risk an unfavorable review.  One of the hallmarks of the  scientific process is the publication of results so that your peers have an  opportunity to review your work and, in some cases, test the adequacy and  accuracy of your work by proposing replication studies.</p>
        <a name="d11" id="d11"></a>
        <p><strong><em>11. Does your research address the mission of the funding agency?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Matching your research agenda with the institute's mission will result in a more   favorable review score because it suggests that you have carefully considered  the relevance of your work to the needs of the funding agency. Sometimes this  match is reflected in a response to a grants announcement; other times it may  be reflected in an unsolicited proposal that significantly extends the  boundaries of your field, but falls within the scope of the funding agency.</p>

        <a name="What do you know" id="What do you know"></a>
        <h3>What Do You Know about the Funding Agency?</h3>
        <a name="e1" id="e1"></a>
        <p><strong><em>1. Can you name two researchers in your field that are currently supported by an  NIH grant?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Knowing others who have been funded by NIH will not improve  your chances of getting funded, but it will increase your knowledge of how the  funding agency operates, what is expected in terms of the presentation of  your science in an application, and what are the most current research  findings in your area.  This knowledge can then be used skillfully as you prepare  your grant application. </p>
        <a name="e2" id="e2"></a>
        <p><strong><em>2. Can you name one researchers in your field who serves on an NIH peer review committee?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Though you are not targeting your research proposal to the needs of the reviewer,  you could profit from knowing members who serve on such committees. This  knowledge will help to achieve the correct level of detail and argument in  your proposal, as well as sensitize you to the needs and expectations of the  committee. </p>
        <a name="e3" id="e3"></a>
        <p><strong><em>3. Can you name a project officer at NIH?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Your Project Officer can be a valuable resource in helping you to shape your  research ideas into a fundable project. The Project Officer should provide  technical assistance including pre-proposal review. </p>
        <a name="e4" id="e4"></a>
        <p><strong><em>4. Can you name a Scientific Review Administrator at NIH?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The Scientific Review Administrator is responsible for the peer   review process, from assignment of reviewers through the actual review   and the development of the Summary Statement. </p>
        <a name="e5" id="e5"></a>
        <p><strong><em>5. Do you have access to NIH's research announcements?</em></strong></p>
        <p>This information is useful in understanding the objectives of the Institute.   For updated or expanded information, contact the officer    responsible for sponsored research activities at your institution or the university library for access  to online search capabilities of the <em>NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts</em>.</p>
        <a name="e6" id="e6"></a>
        <p><strong><em>6. Do small grants have to go to Council for review?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Small grants are reviewed by the IRG committees, but are not sent to the usual  second level of review -- that is, the Council.  This policy allows the Institute to  expedite the funding of these grants. </p>
        <a name="e7" id="e7"></a>
        <p><strong><em>7. Does NIH fund State institutions?</em></strong></p>
        <p>NIH grant awards can be made to State agencies. Usually special forms are  required and in some cases special regulations may apply. Potential applicants  from State agencies should contact their supervisor regarding application  requirements.</p>
        <a name="e8" id="e8"></a>
        <p><strong><em>8. Do the NIH Scientific Review Administrators make funding decisions?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The Scientific Review Administrator's role is limited to the review of the grant  application. Funding decisions are made at the program level, generally by  the appropriate Division Director in consultation with other program staff. </p>
        <a name="e9" id="e9"></a>
        <p><strong><em>9. Will NIH accept a pre-proposal?</em></strong></p>
        <p>It is recommended that you prepare a pre-proposal. Project officers are  required to review these documents and provide technical assistance where  appropriate. </p>
        <a name="e10" id="e10"></a>
        <p><strong><em>10. Will NIH want to invest its resources in your particular proposal?</em></strong></p>
        <p>This can be determined by reviewing  general research announcements, which  can be  found in the Information System. This information is useful in weighing  your proposed research in light of the objectives of an institute.</p>
        <a name="e11" id="e11"></a>
        <p><strong><em>11. Do you know how to contact NIH project officers?</em></strong></p>
        <p>If you can contact a project officer, you will be able to get more information  on how the institute functions and answers to some questions that pertain to  your proposed research.</p>
        <a name="e12" id="e12"></a>
        <p><strong><em>12. Do you know NIH's current budget and research priorities? </em></strong></p>
        <p>Budget and research priorities can be determined from the general and  specific grant announcements, as well as from the Project Officer. By knowing  this information, you can better gauge the appropriateness and timeliness of  your proposed research.</p>
