        <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
        <p> Study designs are usually classified in terms of the temporal   nature of the data and of the number of assessments that are made of   each <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a>.   A number of more specific strategies have been discussed elsewhere and   might be of interest to the reader (although none of these discussions   will be all-encompassing because researchers as a group are highly   creative). Unfortunately, only a discussion of general study designs is   within the scope of this presentation.</p>
        <p><em>Retrospective Studies</em></p>
        <p>These data can be used to identify variables that are related to the   condition of interest. In retrospective studies, the  current condition   of the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> is often known to the person who is being interviewed (e.g., the person   smokes and has lung cancer). In this type of study, a self-selection <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> has almost always occurred; that is, long ago the person may have   chosen the lifestyle that contributed to the condition that the person   has. Relatedly, the factors that may actually be contributors to the   outcome are difficult to measure because the factors were present years   in the past, and the accuracy of long-term memory may be questionable.</p>
        <p>First, <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a>—individuals who have the condition of interest—are identified and a comparison sample, which is the <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> group, is selected. To make a valid comparison, however, the <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> group should resemble the <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a> as much as possible. The <a href="desgloss.html#Controls">controls</a> are usually matched to the <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a> on one or more variables. For an example, when <a href="desgloss.html#Matching">matching</a> on gender, if a female case is admitted to the study, a female <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> is also obtained. If <a href="desgloss.html#Matching">matching</a> on age and gender, if a female case is recruited who is 65 years old, a female <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> who is of a similar age, usually within a couple of years, is obtained. Sometimes <a href="desgloss.html#Overmatching">overmatching</a> can be accomplished to increase the <a href="desgloss.html#Sample-Size">sample size</a>. To utilize <a href="desgloss.html#Overmatching">overmatching</a>, two or three <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> subjects are recruited for every one case. Rarely is there an situation when <a href="desgloss.html#Overmatching">overmatching</a> the other way—two or three <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a> for each <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a>—will occur because usually the number of <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a> is almost always more limited than the number of <a href="desgloss.html#Controls">controls</a>.</p>
        <p> The term <a href="desgloss.html#Overmatching">overmatching</a> has been used in another context, however. In this framework, too many <a href="desgloss.html#Matching">matching</a> variables are used, and finding a comparable <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> may be difficult or impossible. For example, finding a match would be   difficult if a case were an 85 year old man and the criteria on which to   match were: no physical disabilities, high socioeconomic status, and   plays tennis five times a week.</p>
        <p> Several investigators have suggested that long term memory is not especially reliable and can <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> the results of a <a href="desgloss.html#Overmatching">retrospective study</a>.   For example, subjects with severe medical conditions may wish to &quot;help&quot;   the investigator explain the reason that they have developed their   condition, especially if the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has knowledge of the purported <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> between the <a href="desgloss.html#Risk">risk</a> factor in question and his or her condition. For instance, a recovering   alcoholic who suffers a relapse may blame a major life event or a   series of life events for the relapse.</p>
        <p>The benefits of a <a href="desgloss.html#Overmatching">retrospective study</a> are that they are usually quick to conduct and are relatively   inexpensive. The amount of time and expense increases, however, with the   difficulties associated with choosing <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> subjects if a <a href="desgloss.html#Matching">matching</a> scheme is used in the design. The disadvantages are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Potential for self-selection <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a></li>
          <li><a href="desgloss.html#Bias">Bias</a> or unreliability of memory</li>
          <li>Lack of evidence for a <a href="desgloss.html#Causal">causal</a> <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> because determining which condition occurred first is difficult</li>
          <li>Difficulty in finding appropriate <a href="desgloss.html#Controls">controls</a></li>
          <li>Unsuitability for <a href="desgloss.html#Rare-Exposures">rare exposures</a> to a potential <a href="desgloss.html#Risk">risk</a> factor</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Cross-sectional Studies</em></p>
        <p> <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">Cross-sectional</a> studies are conducted to generate a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the current study sample, and thus presumably the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a>. In these studies, data are typically collected across several groups of people. A typical example of <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">cross-sectional</a> studies is a community survey. Note that the &quot;community&quot; can be fairly   specific and can consist of students in a school system, university   faculty, everyone living in this country, or residents living close to a   nuclear reactor. The information gathered in these studies might   include retrospective data such as &quot;How often in the last month did you   exercise for at least 30 minutes?&quot;</p>
        <p> Well-designed <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">cross-sectional</a> studies are often useful when estimating <a href="desgloss.html#Incidence">incidence</a> (the number of new <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a> in a population) or prevalence (the number of <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a>, regardless of when onset occurred) in a population. A study of <a href="desgloss.html#Incidence">incidence</a> might include collecting serologic data to determine individuals who   have been exposed to HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). For prevalence,   a cross-sectional study might be conducted to identify the percentage   of the population who reports illicit drug usage or patterns of heavy   consumption of alcohol. Note, however, that sensitive   information—including information about deviant behavior—is often   difficult to collect on a reliable basis in any study. Most individuals   who engage in that behavior are hesitant to admit to their behaviors   because of a desire to appear within social norms or to avoid legal   hassles. In <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">cross-sectional</a> studies, individuals may be unlikely to provide this type of data to a stranger, particularly if the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has nothing to gain but, as far as the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> knows, prosecution for the illicit behavior.</p>
        <p>A <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">cross-sectional</a> study like any study design has advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of a <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">cross-sectional</a> study are that they can be conducted quickly and the cost per <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> is relatively low. Of course, the study becomes more expensive if the <a href="desgloss.html#Data-Collection">data collection</a> instrument is long, face-to-face interviewers are used instead of phone   interviews, or a large number of subjects is recruited into the study.   The drawbacks are that no information is collected from which causality   can be demonstrated, and for some items, (e.g., sensitive items), the   respondent may tend to provide socially desirable answers rather than   valid ones.</p>
        <p><em>Longitudinal</em></p>
        <p> Typically, longitudinal studies provide data of the highest   quality. The data can often be used as evidence of a temporal   relationship (e.g., perhaps indicating a <a href="desgloss.html#Causal">causal</a><a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a>,   because data are collected from subjects at two or more times during   the study. Unfortunately, data from these studies often take years to   collect, requiring a considerable commitment from the research staff and   the funding agency. Therefore, the expense is much higher than that for   other studies in terms of financial cost and time required to collect   data.</p>
        <p> Several types of longitudinal studies can be conducted. First, a   longitudinal study does not have to be prospective—that is, the study   may not necessarily be designed to follow subjects until a specific   outcome occurs. Information may be obtained from the subjects at   baseline, and again at one or more follow-ups. The baseline or some of   the early follow-up data are assessed to determine if they are   predictive of the outcome of interest, such as the development of cancer   ten to fifteen years after the study began. In this case, the original   study may have been to supply investigators with <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">cross-sectional</a> data, which happened to be useful as baseline data when follow-up could be accomplished. Of course, the <a href="desgloss.html#Outcome-Variable">outcome variable</a> may be defined as <a href="desgloss.html#Morbidity">morbidity</a>, <a href="desgloss.html#Mortality">mortality</a>, remission, recidivism, or change in behavior or attitude.</p>
        <p> <a href="desgloss.html#Prospective-Studies">Prospective studies</a> usually have a more specific purpose than an ordinary longitudinal study. Typically, <a href="desgloss.html#Prospective-Studies">prospective studies</a> are those in which subjects are followed over a specified period of   time or until an event of interest occurs. An example could be one of a   drug abuse treatment program in which success is defined as abstinence   for two years after treatment; the investigators maintain contact with   such subjects for a period until two years or until evidence is obtained   that the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has not been abstinent. Thus, at the end of the second year, all subjects can be defined as &quot;successes&quot; or &quot;failures.&quot;</p>
        <p> On a more experimental level (one in which the researcher manipulates conditions in the study) <a href="desgloss.html#Clinical-Trials">clinical trials</a> can be considered the most desirable type of prospective study when   assessing the efficacy of some treatment because of the  experimental   component into the design. In a clinical trial, two or more groups of   subjects are given different treatments, followed over a period of time,   and the groups are compared to one another on outcome. The decision   about which <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> receives a given mode of treatment should be made by some sort of <a href="desgloss.html#Randomization">randomization</a> procedure—that is each <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has an equal chance of being assigned into each group.</p>
        <p> <a href="desgloss.html#Randomization">Randomization</a> should help ensure that both groups are at least roughly equal on   background characteristics. Investigators should compare the groups on   background variables to confirm that the groups are indeed not   significantly different from one another in terms of variables that may   confound the results. If the <a href="desgloss.html#Data-Collection">data collection</a> portion of the study is not over when imbalances between groups are   noted, group differences may disappear with the addition of more   subjects. If differences do not disappear by the time the data have been   collected, investigators may be able to adjust for the potentially <a href="desgloss.html#Confounding-Variables">confounding variables</a> in a multivariate equation. To do so, however, a statistical expert   should be consulted to avoid problems with misinterpretation of the   results of the analysis.</p>
        <p> <a href="desgloss.html#Clinical-Trials">Clinical trials</a> often consist of subjects who are assigned into either a treatment or a <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> group. The <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> or  comparison group often receives no treatment although in some   studies, e.g., those with medical outcomes, withholding treatment would   be considered unethical. When possible, another good strategy is to have   three groups—treatment, no treatment <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a>, and current preferred treatment. Thus, the <a href="desgloss.html#Placebo">placebo</a> effect—when improvement is found with no treatment, a phenomenon that   usually cannot be explained but that very often occurs in <a href="desgloss.html#Clinical-Trials">clinical trials</a>—is controlled with the inclusion of the no <a href="desgloss.html#Sampling-Unit">treatment group</a>,   and the new treatment can be directly compared to the group that   receives the current treatment of choice. If more &quot;treatments of choice&quot;   exist, then a commensurate number of <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> groups can be added, as long as the investigators are able to administer the comparison treatments as effectively as possible.</p>
        <p> To help remove the possibility of <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a>, most investigators attempt to incorporate a <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> design into the clinical trial.  That is, neither the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> nor the investigator should know the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a>'s treatment status; which is called a double <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> design. If either the researcher or the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has information about the treatment status, the design is single <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a>; if both the researcher and the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> know, the study is not <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> at all.</p>
        <p> The reason for a <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> study is to eliminate the possibility for <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> in the reporting or the recording of data. Obviously,  however, for   medical or behavioral or psychosocial interventions, double <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> or single <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> studies are rarely conducted because the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> or the investigator usually knows the treatment regimen. In such <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a>, the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> should be evaluated by an independent researcher who is <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> to the focus of the study and the treatment regimen to which the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has been assigned.</p>
        <p> Another potential problem with longitudinal studies—particularly <a href="desgloss.html#Clinical-Trials">clinical trials</a>—is   that an investigator may &quot;peek&quot; at the data prior to ending the study.   Such a temptation on the part of the researcher is understandable,   particularly when data have been collected over a period of years—the   investigator is eager to examine the results and may wants to begin   ensuring the data that have been obtained are as error free as possible.   Unfortunately when peeking occurs, the observed results may not be as   attractive as the investigator had hoped, and some consideration may be   given to ending the trial prematurely. Unless the data are absolutely   overwhelming (especially if the experimental treatment has a   significantly adverse effect on subjects), however, the study should be   continued until the scheduled termination date. The subsequent   observations that will provide follow-up may yield data that are so   highly consistent with the investigator's <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> that the significance of the findings may be shaped by the final few   observations. Researchers may be well advised, however, that if the   final few <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a> greatly influence the overall findings, the significance of the results   should be considered highly tenuous because findings are expected to be   reasonably consistent throughout the course of project.</p>
        <p> Finally, in longitudinal studies, <a href="desgloss.html#Attrition">attrition</a> of subjects can adversely influence the data. <a href="desgloss.html#Attrition">Attrition</a> occurs when subjects no longer provide information to the researcher   because they have dropped out of the study, e.g., because they have   moved, become discontent with their involvement in the study, or have   died. In some types of studies, <a href="desgloss.html#Attrition">attrition</a> is not likely to be random. An example would be a drug intervention   study; subjects who refuse follow-up may do so to avoid embarrassment or   fear of prosecution because they have begun to use drugs again.</p>
        <p> One way to reduce <a href="desgloss.html#Attrition">attrition</a> is to offer a cash <a href="desgloss.html#Payment">payment</a> or some other reward for the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a>'s   continued participation in the study. Sometimes, a free physical   examination or some other service that is related to the study design   can be offered relatively inexpensively and with a reasonable amount of   success. These incentives will not, however, ensure the <a href="desgloss.html#Validity">validity</a> of information from those individuals who would have otherwise dropped out of the study.</p>
        <p> Researchers should make every effort to contact subjects who have   dropped out of the study to avoid the obvious criticism that the final   sample, the one containing subjects with follow-up data, is not the same   as the sample that began the study. Sometimes collecting data from   individuals who dropped out of the study may be accomplished by simply   redoubling the effort required for a routine follow-up. Baseline   characteristics of subjects who remained in the study should always be   compared to those of individuals who dropped out of the study to   identify the characteristics that are dissimilar between the two groups.   However, investigators should keep in mind that, because the power of   the test would be unacceptably low, statistical tests are not likely to   be <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> if the number of people who dropped out of  the study is small.   Consequently, researchers should not conclude, if the numbers in either   of the groups is small, that the group who did not participate in the   follow-up is no different from the group  remaining in the study.</p>
        <p> Historical Prospective</p>
        <p> Historical <a href="desgloss.html#Prospective-Studies">prospective studies</a> have some of the same characteristics of a prospective study while   reducing the amount of time that must be invested. Usually, in these   studies <a href="desgloss.html#Archival-Data">archival data</a> is utilized to provide much of the data. <a href="desgloss.html#Archival-Data">Archival data</a> are those which are obtained from documents that typically exist for   some reason other than research purposes—such as medical records.   Subjects are often identified based on their status in these records and   followed over a period of time to yield results similar to from a   longitudinal study.</p>
        <p> For example, an investigator wishes to determine if the drop-out   rate for urban high school students is related to drug involvement.   Examination of police or school records could be used to identify   individuals with drug histories; thus the rate of these individuals   dropping out of school can be compared to that of students in other   categories.</p>
        <p> Unfortunately, archival records may not contain all of the information the investigator needs to adequately test the <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>,   or the data may be maintained at the archival source in such a way that   using the available information in data analysis would be impossible.   Another potential problem is that archival records do not necessarily   contain valid or complete information because the individuals who   recorded the information may not have been especially meticulous.   Moreover, the quality of the data in an archival source may be <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a>; individuals with particular problems or characteristics may be more likely to have incomplete records, for example. Finally, <a href="desgloss.html#Attrition">attrition</a> can occur in these  studies, too, with individuals who would have been   categorized in one group no longer accessible to the investigator.</p>
