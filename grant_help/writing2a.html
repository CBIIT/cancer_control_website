        	<h3>The Grant Writing Process - Budgeting</h3>
				<h4>Budget Preparation - General Concepts and Strategies</h4>
                <p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>
                <p>No funding agency would fund a research project, contract, or grant without a detailed description accompanied by a persuasive justification of the costs to be incurred. Itemized cost estimates are generally required in a budget format. The budget must be prepared with a great deal of thoughtfulness, since it will be reviewed by a number of people at the funding agency. Some reviewers will examine every dollar requested to determine whether the figures add up while (more importantly) others will examine the relevance of cost items to the proposed research.</p>
                <p><strong><em>General Concepts</em></strong></p>
                <p>Budget preparation can be a very difficult and time consuming process. The budget preparer must be able to identify and accurately estimate all costs necessary to complete the research project. Some organizations have finance departments or offices of sponsored research to provide support in developing the budget. Nevertheless, the principal investigator (PI) or the project manager is responsible for ensuring that the costs outlined in the budget are accurate and are reflected in the research being proposed.</p>
                <p>While the PI can and should receive help in estimating the costs of each of the activities of the research, he or she must understand the research well enough to know what activities are necessary to complete it. Therefore, the PI must first understand all aspects of the proposed research before a final budget can be prepared.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Competence of the Principal Investigator</em></strong></p>
                <p>To receive funding for a research proposal, the principal investigator must be able to demonstrate his or her competence to do rigorous research. This competence is conveyed not only in the "research methods", "background", and "significance" sections of the grant application, but also in the budget. PI's who drastically underestimate the costs necessary to complete the research may not convey the level of competence necessary to receive a fundable priority score. On the other hand, those who greatly overestimate the costs may be viewed as attempting to pad the budget in order to obtain funding to complete some other project.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Estimating Costs</em></strong></p>
                <p>The PI generally does not receive additional funds to compensate for an underestimation of project costs and therefore must accurately estimate the costs for each year of the project. This is a very real problem for PIs who propose research projects spanning many years. In the PHS grant system, PIs generally propose research projects varying from 1 to 5 years in length. For the new researcher, estimating current as well as future costs may present a problem that can be resolved by talking with a more experienced researcher and through the organization's grant support mechanism.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Proposal Costs and the Funding Agency</em></strong></p>
                <p>The proposal costs must also be in line with the funds available at the funding agency for research of the type being proposed. It is not wise, for example, to propose a $2 million research project to an agency with only $1 million available for research in the particular field. Funding agency grant announcements often provide information about the number of grants to be funded and the amounts available in particular areas of research. Yet the amount that may be realistically acquired by the PI may also depend on the PI's level of research experience. New researchers are recommended to start with smaller research projects with correspondingly smaller budgets. An established track record of research may be critical for PIs who wish to receive funding for relatively large research projects.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Importance of Overall Consistency</em></strong></p>
                <p>Finally, reviewers look for an overall level of consistency throughout the research proposal, including the budget section. The proposed research must match the costs outlined in the budget. For example, if the PI describes the testing of 100 patients in the research methods section, the PI must also list testing costs for no more or less than 100 patients in the budget section.</p>
