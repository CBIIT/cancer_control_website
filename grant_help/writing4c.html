        <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
        <p><em>The Characteristics of the Sample</em></p>
        <p>Before the sample can be selected, the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a> must be identified. The <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a> should be specifically defined. Naturally, the study population should resemble the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a> as closely as possible because the results from the study should be   generalizable. If the subjects in the sample have characteristics   different from the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a>, these differences must be considered potential confounders. <a href="desgloss.html#Confounding-Variables">Confounding variables</a> influence the results, but are not directly related to the <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>.</p>
        <p>Controlling for, or partialling out the effects of these confounders related to a <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> sample is virtually  impossible. Therefore, if the study sample does not represent the <a href="desgloss.html#Population-Of-Interest">population of interest</a>,   the study will likely yield information of application only to the   study's subjects, and the findings will be of little value elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Once the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a> is identified, the researcher should develop specific guidelines about   subjects' eligibility criteria. These guidelines would reflect both <a href="desgloss.html#Inclusionary-Criteria">inclusionary criteria</a> and <a href="desgloss.html#Exclusionary-Criteria">exclusionary criteria</a>—characteristics   that will  make the person ineligible for the study. For an example, in   study of the effects of a single moderate dose an illicit drug on   cognitive functioning, the <a href="desgloss.html#Inclusionary-Criteria">inclusionary criteria</a> for subjects might  be: 1) between the ages of 12 and 18 (an age arbitrarily chosen, and for this example, in which the <a href="desgloss.html#Risk">risk</a> of using this drug is highest); 2) of at least a normal level of   cognitive ability; and 3) male (because males are much more likely to   use the imaginary drug in question). The <a href="desgloss.html#Exclusionary-Criteria">exclusionary criteria</a> could be:  1) not having been unconscious for more than 7 minutes after   a trauma to the head (to eliminate the possibility of otherwise latent   organic damages confounding the results); and 2) no history of drug   abuse  (to rule out the possibility that chronic drug use exacerbates or   magnifies the effects from an acute dosage of the drug).</p>
        <p>Thus, the study sample should be selected based on rigorous specific   criteria, otherwise the results may not be replicable by other   researchers. An indication about the representativeness of the sample   could come from a comparison of the characteristics of those who refused   to be included in the study to those who participated as subjects. In   longitudinal studies, similar analyses can be conducted to determine if   the people who drop out of the study were different than those who   remained in the study. If the study participants were found to be   different from those who were not in the study, the results could be <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> because the subjects who were potentially the &quot;worst <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a>&quot; were not included in the study.</p>
        <p>When the <a href="desgloss.html#Outcome-Variable">outcome variable</a> is related to a sensitive topic such as drug abuse, potential subjects   may refuse participation or already recruited subjects may decline   further participation because they feel guilty about engaging in an   illicit activity. Not obtaining data from these individuals will likely <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> the outcome of the study.</p>
        <p><em>The Sample Size</em></p>
        <p>Closely related to the generalizability of the study group to the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a> is the size of the sample. Assuming no <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> was present during the selection of the sample, the larger the <a href="desgloss.html#Sample-Size">sample size</a>,   the more likely it will have characteristics similar to that of the   larger target group. Small samples, because of chance selection, may   yield observations that are not representative of the <a href="desgloss.html#Population-Of-Interest">population of interest</a>.   For this reason, the results of most studies with small samples should   be regarded with some caution. Although statistical tests with small   samples require a <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> in which the magnitude is relatively large before a <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> result is found, the potential remains for the results from small studies to be ungeneralizable to the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a>.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><a href="desgloss.html#Power-Calculations">Power calculations</a> should be generated at some point when the study is being designed to   determine the number of subjects that should be recruited into the   study. The results of <a href="desgloss.html#Power-Calculations">power calculations</a> help ensure that <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> results are found if a <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> truly exists. Any one of several computer packages can be used to yield   estimates of the power of the test. Statistical power is based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expected magnitude of the <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a></li>
          <li>Number of subjects</li>
          <li>Expected variability of the data</li>
          <li>Level of <a href="desgloss.html#Alpha">alpha</a></li>
          <li>Type of <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> (one versus <a href="desgloss.html#Two-Tailed">two-tailed</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any one of these values can be calculated if the information from the others is available. Typically, investigators know:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The expected magnitude of the <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> found in previous studies, although some tendency to be overly optimistic about the strength of the <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> that would be found in the proposed study is not unusual among investigators. Such optimism is nonetheless ill-advised</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>The level of <a href="desgloss.html#Alpha">alpha</a>, which is the p value at which a finding will be accepted as statistically <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> (e.g., the probability that the observed <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> is not likely to be a result of chance or of random fluctuations in the data), usually set at .05</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>The variability of the data (e.g., for <a href="desgloss.html#Continuous">continuous</a> scales indicated by the <a href="desgloss.html#Dose-Response-Relationships">standard deviations</a>)</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>The direction of the <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>, whether it is <a href="desgloss.html#One-Tailed">one-tailed</a> (e.g., the <a href="desgloss.html#Sampling-Unit">treatment group</a> will have a better outcome than the <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> group) or <a href="desgloss.html#Two-Tailed">two-tailed</a> (e.g., which group will have a better outcome is unknown—the new   treatment will differ in efficacy from the group receiving the current   standard of treatment). Typically, the investigator will need to   calculate either the number of subjects needed based on an acceptable <a href="desgloss.html#Risk">risk</a> for a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-II-Error">Type II error</a> (usually defined as .20 which means that the researcher has an 80% chance of identifying a truly <a href="desgloss.html#Significant">significant</a> result) or if the researcher knows the number of subjects available, the <a href="desgloss.html#Risk">risk</a> for a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-II-Error">Type II error</a> can be estimated. Unfortunately, researchers are often surprised to find that the initially proposed <a href="desgloss.html#Sample-Size">sample size</a> is not sufficient to yield an acceptably low <a href="desgloss.html#Risk">risk</a> of a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-II-Error">Type II error</a>.</li>
          <br />
          <br />
        </ol>
The study should not be conducted if the <a href="desgloss.html#Risk">risk</a> for a <a href="desgloss.html#Type-II-Error">Type II error</a> is too high (i.e., more than 20%). In such a case the  researcher,   support staff, and the subjects would be wasting their time contributing   to a study that will likely be of little value. Worse, if the study   were conducted and if the results of the study were published, the   findings may be misleading and could be widely distributed among the   research community, diverting future research from more worthy projects.<br />
<br />
<p><em>Methods of Selecting Potential Subjects</em></p>
<p>The method of selecting subjects is a crucial part of the research   project. First the investigator must determine whether the subjects of   interest are accessible, and whether the source of subjects would   provide a <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> sample. Each method of recruitment that is outlined below has   advantages and disadvantages; however, regardless of the methods used,   the researcher should be as certain as possible that the sample is not <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a>.</p>
<p><em>Random Samples</em></p>
<p>The most convincing method of obtaining an unbiased study population is to use some type of <a href="desgloss.html#Random-Selection">random selection</a> from the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a>. If the sample is large enough, the group of subjects will not likely differ much from the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a>, thereby virtually ensuring generalizability of the data. <a href="desgloss.html#Random-Selection">Random selection</a> is when <a href="desgloss.html#Sampling-Unit">sampling unit</a> has an equal chance of being selected; usually an individual <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> is a <a href="desgloss.html#Sampling-Unit">&quot;sampling unit</a>&quot;, but can also be a family, organization, or some other group of people. If the study is focused on treatment efficacy, <a href="desgloss.html#Randomization">randomization</a> can be used to assign the available subjects to the various study groups. The term <a href="desgloss.html#Random-Selection">&quot;random selection</a>&quot;   should not suggest that the subjects were identified in a willy-nilly   fashion. In fact, a considerable amount of effort might be expended to   assure potential critics of the study that the <a href="desgloss.html#Random-Selection">random selection</a> scheme has worked. Random number generators may suffer a glitch or a   propensity to develop patterns of numbers that may conceivably <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> the results. Rolling a die may produce a <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> sample if the die has pitted rather than painted dots; when the die is   pitted, &quot;6&quot; is most likely to be rolled because of the additional weight   on the opposite side of the die, the &quot;1&quot;; therefore obtaining a higher   percentage of even  numbers is more likely as is higher percentage of   high numbers (4, 5 and 6). Because group assignment may be based on the   result of the odd or even roll, one group may be overrepresented,   presenting problems in the analysis of the data.  Random telephone   dialers provide <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> data for some studies because not all people, particularly American Indians and some recent immigrants, have telephones.</p>
<p>Frequently, investigators prefer to use a simplified method of sampling, such as <a href="desgloss.html#Systematic">systematic</a> sampling. Instead of a random number table to select subjects, a list   of potential subjects is obtained, and the names are counted. The number   of potential subjects is divided by the number of subjects needed for   the data analysis yielding the variable <em>n</em>. The investigator then selects every <em>nth</em> person on the list. For example, if a list has 2100 names, and a power   analysis indicates that the investigators needs 100 subjects to   participate in the study, every twenty-first <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> is approach to participate in the study. Usually instead of counting from the first <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a>,   a random number between 1 and 100 (or some other arbitrary number that   is reasonably high) will be generated, and the counting begins from the   random number. If, for whatever  reason, the number of subjects needed   for the study is not obtained (e.g., the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> refused to participate) with the first pass through the data, the   process can begin again, using a different &quot;seed&quot; number—the number at   which the first <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> is picked.</p>
<p>This procedure will not work well, however, if the subjects are arranged in some type of <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> manner (e.g., in a prison population, every twenty-first prisoner on   the list is an axe murderer; every twenty-second prisoner an arsonist,   etc.).</p>
<p>Another method of obtaining subjects is by using <a href="desgloss.html#Cluster-Sampling">cluster sampling</a>. For <a href="desgloss.html#Cluster-Sampling">cluster sampling</a>, an organizational unit is  systematically divided into its logical smaller components; <a href="desgloss.html#Randomization">randomization</a> is accomplished at each level until the smallest organizational unit is   selected and the sample requirements are satisfied. For an example, a   study is conducted by a large corporation. First departments   (representing the largest <a href="desgloss.html#Sampling-Unit">sampling unit</a>)   are randomly selected; next divisions in those departments are randomly   identified and then sections in the divisions are chosen. All   individuals in the selected sections would then be assessed. The   potential for <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> exists, then, if the various departments (or the divisions or sections)   contain individuals with characteristics different from the other   departments.</p>
<p>However, random samples will sometimes yield a study population that   resembles the target group, but some of the  subgroups of interest will   have <a href="desgloss.html#Sample-Size">sample sizes</a> that are too small for data analysis. If the investigator is interested   in these subgroups, a stratified random sample should be obtained.</p>
<p>In this case, each individual within the subgroups has an equal   probability of being chosen, but the smaller groups of people are   disproportionately oversampled. Recently conducted national <a href="desgloss.html#Surveys">surveys</a> are stratified random samples; if a random sample were obtained, the   number of subjects in some ethnic subgroups would be too small to   provide enough information for analysis. Consequently, instead of a   sample that contains 13% Blacks, this subgroup could be oversampled to   yield a study group that may contain 26% Blacks. Whites may have   contributed 70% to a random sample but in this example may only   contribute 57% to a stratified random sample; however, this percentage   of Whites should produce sufficient numbers of subjects on which the   data can be analyzed for that subgroup.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method of <a href="desgloss.html#Randomization">randomization</a>, one or two trials of the method should be conducted before subjects are obtained or assigned to <a href="desgloss.html#Sampling-Unit">treatment groups</a>. Despite the success of these trials, a <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> sample can still be obtained from the luck, (or the lack of it), of the   draw. Usually, though, obtaining a large number of subjects will yield a   sample that resembles the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a> for most variables. Smaller samples are more susceptible to suffering from <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a>, regardless of the sampling technique.</p>
<p>An example of a method that will not result in a <a href="desgloss.html#Random-Assignment">random assignment</a> of subjects into groups is a physician who wants to assess  the   efficacy of an intervention technique. Rather than developing a <a href="desgloss.html#Random-Assignment">random assignment</a> process, the physician assigns the first patient of the day to the experimental condition, the second patient to the <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> condition, and the subsequent patients are alternated between the two   groups throughout the day. The next day, the process is repeated.   Unfortunately, the physician may have developed a tendency to see   patients with the most challenging condition first. Therefore, the   experimental condition continually receives the most difficult patient   of the day, biasing the sample.</p>
<p><em>Nonrandom Samples</em></p>
<p>Often, a random sample is not practical or, for other reasons, cannot   be obtained. A constraint to obtaining a random sample is having a list   of <a href="desgloss.html#Sampling-Unit">sampling unit</a>s   from which the selection will be made. Alternative sampling techniques   are available and can yield high quality data. However, again, the   investigator must take the appropriate steps to ensure that the data are   not <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a>.</p>
<p>Possibly the method of sampling that is most likely to yield a <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> sample is in recruiting individuals as they come to a clinic, a   university classroom, or some other institution. Obtaining a sample in   such a way is usually done by convenience because the investigator   usually has ready access to those populations; thus the sample is called   a convenience sample. Individuals who are recruited in this manner may   have characteristics that are not consistent with those of the <a href="desgloss.html#Target-Population">target population</a>. Subjects in a convenience sample may be, and probably are, different from the <a href="desgloss.html#Population-Of-Interest">population of interest</a> in terms of socioeconomic status, rate of adherence to treatment regimens, level of cognitive functioning,  etc.</p>
<p>For some research questions such as drug abuse patterns in a community, identifying or contacting potential subjects for a <a href="desgloss.html#Randomization">randomization</a> scheme is impossible. For example, in a study of drug use among street   gangs, the most practical means by which potential sources of   information can be identified may be to contact a known source who will   direct the investigator to other subjects. These subjects will hopefully   be cooperative in providing data and additional sources of contact.   This method of sampling is called &quot;snowball&quot; sampling, and is typical in   ethnographic research. Of course, the quality of the sample may depend   on the initial contact, but presumably after several subsequent contacts   are made, the researcher has identified individuals who will provide   the highest quality information that is least susceptible to <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a>.</p>
<p>Another strategy to obtain subjects is by <a href="desgloss.html#Quota-Sampling">quota sampling</a>. In this strategy, <a href="desgloss.html#Power-Calculations">power calculations</a> are generated and a desired number of people who fall into a predefined category is obtained. For example, a <a href="desgloss.html#Telephone-Interview">telephone interviewer</a> using a random dialing computer program may then contact a large number   of individuals. Based on a short questionnaire, potential subjects can   be screened. Categories are based on well defined characteristics (e.g.,   gender, age, income, and/or ethnic group). Once a quota is filled, no   other information is needed or obtained from individuals with that set   of characteristics.</p>
<p><em>Other Considerations</em></p>
<p>Many investigators are a bit myopic when criticizing their own   studies and, in particular, do not readily recognize the instances when   their sample is atypical or <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a>. Nonetheless, investigators should be aware if their sample is composed of individuals with <a href="desgloss.html#Unusual-Characteristics">unusual characteristics</a> (e.g., they are all being treated for psychosis) that are not germane to the study and may influence the results. Sometimes <a href="desgloss.html#Unusual-Characteristics">unusual characteristics</a> that influence data are not immediately apparent; however, the   investigator should be in a position to determine if there is any factor   that may be affect the subjects' responses. For example, assessing   psychological affect in a population living close to Three Mile Island   within a few days of the now famous nuclear accident would surely yield   interesting data; however, the researchers should not imply that the   data would be representative of a typical community that had not been   exposed to the incident.</p>
<p>Further, investigators should be cognizant of the fact that the   design itself may influence responses. For example,  videotaping an   interaction between admitted drug users may  yield data of questionable <a href="desgloss.html#Validity">validity</a> because such subjects may be reticent to discuss candidly (or document) their past history of drug use.</p>
