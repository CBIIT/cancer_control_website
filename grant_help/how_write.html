        <p><a name="writing" id="writing"></a><em><strong>The writing process</strong></em></p>
        <p>Please keep the following tips in mind when writing your grant:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Know your audience, and write to them.</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>Write clearly enough for the primary reviewer to fully grasp,   easily explain, and be able to answer questions about what you are   proposing. Other reviewers may focus only on your abstract,   significance, and specific aims.</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>Make a clear case for why your hypothesis should be funded, why   you are the person to do the research, and how your institution will   support you in getting it done.</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>Your proposed research should be innovative, and should also   have the data to support your innovative approach - especially if it   challenges current ways of thinking about the problem you are proposing   to investigate.</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>Since not all reviewers will be technically proficient in your   field, it may be wise to limit technical information to the methodology   section. Write less technically in the sections most reviewers are   likely to read: the abstract, significance, and specific aims sections.   You might also include both technical and nontechnical information   throughout your proposal, beginning each section with simple   information, and progressing to the more detailed for those who wish to   continue.</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>Make your application easy for busy reviewers to read by   submitting a neat, well organized document. Keep your application short   and to the point, label all materials clearly so that reviewers can find   information, and use graphics to break up text and to help reviewers   grasp concepts. Make sure to edit and proof your application, as typos   and internal inconsistencies can lower your score.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Reviewers use five criteria to evaluate investigator-initiated   research grant applications. The review criteria serve as important   assessment tools for the review committees. Nonetheless, not all   committees adhere equally to the review criteria, and your application   does not have to be strong in every review criteria to receive a   high-priority score.  Reviewers' judgments of an application's overall   merit, as well as its usefulness in relation to the current science in   the field of proposed study, also influence their scores. In addition to   addressing the review criteria, it is important to prepare a well-   written application that makes a clear, persuasive argument for why NIH   should fund your work.</p>
        <p>The five criteria reviewers use to evaluate investigator-initiated review are as follow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Significance</strong>. Does this study address an   important problem? If the aims are achieved, how will scientific   knowledge or clinical practice be advanced? What will be the effect of   these studies on the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments,   services, or preventions that drive this field?</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><strong>Approach</strong>. Are the conceptual or clinical   framework, design, methods, and analyses adequately developed, well   integrated, well reasoned, and appropriate to the aims of the project?   Does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider   alternative tactics?</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><strong>Innovation</strong>. Is the project original and   innovative? For example: Does it challenge existing paradigms or   clinical practice or address an innovative hypothesis or critical   barrier to progress in the field? Does the project develop or use novel   concepts, approaches, methods, tools, or technologies?</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><strong>Investigators</strong>. Are the investigators   appropriately trained and well suited to carry out this work? Is the   work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the principal   investigator and other researchers? Does the investigative team bring   complementary and integrated expertise to the project (if applicable)?</li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><strong>Environment</strong>. Does the scientific environment   contribute to the probability of success? Do the studies benefit from   unique features of the scientific environment or subject populations or   use useful collaborative arrangements? Is there evidence of   institutional support?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Reviewers are capable, experienced scientists, but they can't know   everything. Not all reviewers will be experts in your specific area of   study, so it is important that you be clear about the significance of   your proposed research, as well as your methods.  Demonstrate that your   lab is equipped to complete the research you are. Write clearly and   concisely, and submit a neat, organized, and attractive proposal.</p>
        <p>The following is a list of reasons that reviewers often cite for   denying applications. As you develop and present your research idea,   make sure you have not committed these errors:</p>
