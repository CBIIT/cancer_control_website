        <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
        <p><em>Data</em></p>
        <p>The quality of the data collected in a research project is inextricably related to the worthiness of that project.   Researchers should generally not only know the data from their research   project well but also understand tenets about data. Much of the   following discussion is related to concepts that will be important   during the data analysis. To convince a grant review committee that the   potential grantee knows how to conduct research and data analysis, the   applicant should demonstrate a knowledge about data and the selection of   data analytic methods.</p>
        <p><em>Types of Data</em></p>
        <p>The classification of data is necessary to conceptualize the quality   of the data and to be able to select the appropriate statistical test   for the analysis.</p>
        <p><a href="desgloss.html#Nominal-Data">Nominal data</a> have no natural order (e.g., cannot be ranked from good to bad or first to last) and thus are strictly <a href="desgloss.html#Categorical">categorical</a>. Examples of <a href="desgloss.html#Nominal-Data">nominal data</a> are: gender (male/female), <a href="desgloss.html#Ethnicity">ethnicity</a> (Hispanic, Black, White), source of <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> (urban/rural, school A/school B, etc.), or treatment status (experimental, <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a>).</p>
        <p><a href="desgloss.html#Ordinal Data">Ordinal data</a> can also be classified as <a href="desgloss.html#Categorical">categorical</a> data, but the subgroups have some type of sequence. For instance, a   person's condition can be classified as &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor.&quot;   Individuals may respond to a question as either &quot;strongly agree,&quot;   &quot;agree,&quot; &quot;neither agree nor disagree,&quot; &quot;disagree,&quot; or &quot;strongly   disagree.&quot; Because ordinal scales have some gradation in quality, they   usually provide more information than the &quot;either/or&quot; classification of   nominal scales. However, the range of ordinal scales is usually quite   limited—from 2 levels to perhaps 7 or more levels; the more levels the   scale has, the more the data can be considered <a href="desgloss.html#Continuous">continuous</a> data.</p>
        <p>A type of scale that provides more information than <a href="desgloss.html#Ordinal Data">ordinal data</a> is that of <a href="desgloss.html#Experimenter-Expectancy-Effects">interval data</a>. The points on the scale are much more numerous than on an ordinal scale (making a <a href="desgloss.html#Continuous">continuous</a> scale), and the increments between the data points are consistent   throughout the scale. Examples of interval scales are: the Fahrenheit   scale, calendar dates, and scores from various psychosocial tests.</p>
        <p><a href="desgloss.html#Ratio-Scales">Ratio scales</a> provide the most information of any type of measure, and are similar to   interval scales with the exception that a ratio scale has a true zero   point. Examples of ratio data are: the Kelvin scale measures of   distance, and timed events.</p>
        <p>General considerations about data types include the fact that scales   can be converted &quot;down&quot; in quality. That is, the points on an interval   scale can be collapsed to form an ordinal scale that has a more   restricted range of data (e.g., test scores of individuals can be   classified into those who scored in the highest third, the middle third,   and the lowest third of the sample). Such manipulation can be useful   for examining nonlinear relationships or differences between the   &quot;highest&quot; and the &quot;lowest&quot; scores. However, a scale can never be   converted &quot;up&quot; in quality; a nominal scale can never yield <a href="desgloss.html#Ordinal Data">ordinal data</a>,   for instance. The exception is when the scale was originally interval   or ratio and recategorized, in which case the initial values may be   restored to an ordinal scale.</p>
        <p><em>Dependence Versus Independence</em></p>
        <p>Using computers to <a href="desgloss.html#Analyze">analyze</a> data has become common. Calculating the results of statistical tests by   hand or by using a calculator is rarely recommended; time is wasted and   errors in the analysis are more likely to occur. However, the   alternative use of computer assisted statistical packages has some   drawbacks, too. One of these involves the nomenclature in which   &quot;dependent&quot; and &quot;independent&quot; variables must often be identified to   conduct the analysis. Unfortunately, investigators may fall into the   trap of accepting the fact that the <a href="desgloss.html#Outcome-Variable">outcome variable</a>, which is almost  always used as the &quot;dependent&quot; variable, is truly dependent on the influence of <a href="desgloss.html#Dependent-Variables">independent variables</a>. As noted elsewhere, however, <a href="desgloss.html#Causal">causal</a> data are never obtained from <a href="desgloss.html#Cross-Sectional">cross-sectional</a> studies, and therefore, the <a href="desgloss.html#Outcome-Variable">outcome variable</a> should not be considered dependent on the <a href="desgloss.html#Dependent-Variables">independent variables</a>. Researchers who overstate the confidence with which their data are <a href="desgloss.html#Causal">causal</a> may be more likely to obtain lower priority scores when submitting a grant.</p>
        <p><em>Missing Data</em></p>
        <p>The amount of <a href="desgloss.html#Missing Data">missing data</a> that the study suffers is often annoying and may place the <a href="desgloss.html#Validity">validity</a> of the study in question.  Subjects may find a question offensive or   confusing and decide not to respond to that item; sometimes an entire   page of questions is inadvertently skipped; the person collecting or <a href="desgloss.html#Coding">coding</a> the data may have been careless; an interview is prematurely terminated by the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> because of time constraints, or parts of the questionnaire are mixed   with other papers and lost. Investigators usually have to make some   decision about what to do when <a href="desgloss.html#Missing Data">missing data</a> is identified.</p>
        <p>In general, if a <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has contributed no data on a variable that will be used in a particular analysis, dropping that <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> from the analysis is probably advisable. However, including such   subjects in the analysis can be accomplished by 1) inserting the mean   score as that person's value or 2) estimating the scores with regression   analysis from values obtained from nonmissing subjects. These two   methods, however, are weak because they assume that the person with the   missing value is probably similar to the rest of the sample. Such an   assumption is perhaps a giant leap of faith  because the rest of the   sample was different in at least the fact that they did not have a   missing value on the scale or item of interest.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, <a href="desgloss.html#Missing Data">missing data</a> can be captured by increasing the vigor with which it is pursued. That   is, if the data have come from archival records, other sources that   provide the same type of information may be consulted, or another <a href="desgloss.html#Data-Collection">data collection</a> person may be sent to the source of the data to reexamine the records that are incomplete. <a href="desgloss.html#Missing Data">Missing data</a> in longitudinal studies are a particular problem because of <a href="desgloss.html#Attrition">attrition</a>. Sometimes in longitudinal studies, <a href="desgloss.html#Missing Data">missing data</a> can be reduced by redoubling efforts to track down the subjects who were lost to follow-up.</p>
        <p><em>Bias</em></p>
        <p>Investigators are often slow to recognize the possibility that their data suffers or will suffer from <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> because of a design flaw. <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">Bias</a> is a condition that causes the results to be skewed either toward or away from significance. <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">Bias</a> is always <a href="desgloss.html#Systematic">systematic</a>, consistently influencing the data one way or the other, and permeates or runs throughout the data set.</p>
        <p>Although hardly ever intended, the experimenter or investigator can   defeat the purpose of the study—providing usable data to the field—by   introducing <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> into the data in any number of ways. The most obvious form of experimenter <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> is that the investigator expects to find a certain <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> and does find such a <a href="desgloss.html#Relationship">relationship</a> without support from <a href="desgloss.html#Objective">objective</a> <a href="desgloss.html#Instruments">instruments</a>.   For example, a study is conducted by a proponent for a certain type of   drug intervention therapy. The researcher uses a widely accepted scale   of drug abuse which is administered verbally and is used in this study   to assess the patient's pre- and post-treatment condition. Particularly   if 1) the treatment is found effective, 2) the researcher conducts the   interviews, and 3) no <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> group is used, critics will almost surely raise the question of <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a>. The investigator, who is very closely attached to the <a href="desgloss.html#Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>,   may well give the client the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; on various items   when the post-treatment interview is given, inflating the observed   effect of the treatment. Similar criticisms may also arise if the   researcher employs interviewers, if these individuals are trained by the   investigator. The researcher may be able to transfer biases to those   who will conduct the interview. Despite using a <a href="desgloss.html#Control">control</a> group, if the interviewers are not <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> to the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject's</a> treatment status, a charge of <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a>, which will not be easily answered, may be leveled at the study.</p>
        <p>Moreover, experimenter <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> may also exist when the researcher accurately records the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a>'s   responses. Investigators may influence the subjects' responses by   posing items in such a way to elicit a desired response. The cues   provided by the researcher need not be verbal, with facial changes' or   certain behaviors' having the potential for prejudicing the data.</p>
        <p>Subjects, too, can be the source of <a href="desgloss.html#Experimenter-Expectancy-Effects">bias</a> as indicated by the above example where responses may be more influenced by <a href="desgloss.html#External">external</a> cues. Typically, items that may solicit <a href="desgloss.html#Biased">biased</a> responses are those that may allow socially desirable answers. Deviant behavior such as illicit drug use may be denied by a <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> to continue to appear socially acceptable to the investigator. Similarly, if the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> suspects that a certain response is expected, the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> will often try to accommodate the researcher by providing the perceived   desired answer. Such a problem may be especially found  in studies that   are designed to assess the efficacy of some treatment. When the <a href="desgloss.html#t-Test">post-test</a> data are collected, the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> knows the treatment was administered and what the outcome was expected to be, and thus the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> renders the expected response. Again, such an issue may be magnified if   the treatment is one for a deviant behavior such as drug abuse or,   usually to a lesser extent, for a behavior that is merely seen to be   undesirable, such as cigarette smoking. In such <a href="desgloss.html#Cases">cases</a>, investigators may do well to assess the treatment outcome through different means, rather than relying solely on <a href="desgloss.html#Self-Report">self-report</a>.</p>
        <p>When developing a grant application or writing a paper for a study in which <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a> may be an issue, researchers should emphasize the steps taken to minimize the <a href="desgloss.html#Bias">bias</a>. Double<a href="desgloss.html#Blind">-blind</a> designs should be used whenever possible, and the fact that a <a href="desgloss.html#Blind">blind</a> design was or is going to be used should be highlighted for reviewers   when appropriate. If utilizing interviewers is part of the design, the   level of training that they will receive, their experience conducting   interviews, and, if possible, their disinterest in the outcome of the   study should be stressed. Researchers should chose <a href="desgloss.html#Instruments">instruments</a> that obtain <a href="desgloss.html#Objective">objective</a> responses, and again the grant proposal or paper should provide evidence that such will be the case.</p>
        <p><em>Error</em></p>
        <p>Two sources of error that occur in virtually every research project   are caused by the instrument itself (e.g., the items are ambiguously   worded or the response categories are inappropriate) or the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> (e.g., items were misread, problems of memory). The results from most <a href="desgloss.html#Instruments">instruments</a> that were designed to produce the most marginally sensitive results contain at least some error because as <a href="desgloss.html#Sensitivity">sensitivity</a> increases, <a href="desgloss.html#Specificity">specificity</a> decreases, which reduces the precision of the instrument. However,   items that would be expected  to be completely reliable (e.g., r=1.00)   are often not. For example, when subjects are asked their gender at two   points in  time, a perfect <a href="desgloss.html#Correlation">correlation</a> between the Time 1 and Time 2 administration would not be expected,   even though the variable gender is typically considered to be constant.   Again subjects may mistakenly respond with the wrong value.</p>
        <p>Error can also arise during <a href="desgloss.html#Coding">coding</a> (e.g., the coder misinterprets or misreads a response) or <a href="desgloss.html#Experimenter-Expectancy-Effects">data entry</a> (e.g., the data  entry person enters a typo or cannot read the code and guesses the response). The errors that occur after the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> has finished the interview can be addressed in several ways. Perhaps one of the most desirable is to have the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a> enter responses directly into a computer file from prompts at a   computer terminal. This method may be expensive in terms of computer   resources—although if the subjects are mailed the diskette to be used on   the <a href="desgloss.html#Subject">subject</a>'s   own computer, the cost would be minimal—the reduction in error and the   increased integrity of the data set would be more assured. When  such   technology is not available to collect the subjects' responses directly,   other means of protecting the quality of the data can be used, although   here an assumption is being made that the data will be analyzed on a   computer. In such a case, the most preferable method of ensuring data   quality is that the data be entered twice into separate computerized   datasets and the contents of the two datasets compared. Discrepancies   between the two databases are quickly identified and the corrections can   then be made. A less accurate but also less expensive method to examine   the quality of the data is to merely examine the frequency counts and   percentages of the response levels to 1) identify out of range values,   such as  an age of 95 years or 2) examine the prevalence of impossible   combinations—a data set that had a high rate (e.g., &gt; 1%) of male   breast cancer patients should be suspect. When these values are   identified, the original <a href="desgloss.html#Data-Collection">data collection</a> sheets must be consulted to resolve the inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>Because computers have become ubiquitous in research because they can be used to <a href="desgloss.html#Analyze">analyze</a> large amounts of data quickly and effectively, errors in programming should be of concern. In some research projects, <a href="desgloss.html#Missing-Values">missing values</a> are coded with an out of range value, such as &quot;99&quot;, and a line will be   included in a computer program will identify this value as &quot;missing&quot;.   Forgetting to identify these values as missing may yield some rather   interesting, as opposed to valid, results when statistical tests are   applied to the data because the computer package will treat &quot;99&quot; as a   true  numeric value. In this example, individuals in a treatment program   may be found to have a <a href="desgloss.html#Median">median</a> age of 25 when the group was obtained exclusively from a high school;   the average age would have been inflated by including some 99 year old   high school sophomores in the analysis. Another potential programming   error includes misassigning individuals into the wrong group for   analysis; this particular problem is more likely to be observed in   programs that  are especially complex.</p>
