    Dr. Edwards gave a short presentation, Tumor Registries &#8211; NCI&#8217;s Role in International Activities, to the NCAB subcommittee, June 24, 2012.  It covered the SEER Program and its impact on cancer surveillance, research, and control nationally and globally.  With the increase in cancer worldwide, registries are essential to having the capacity to measure its impact on all populations, but the coverage is low, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  Numerous reports have identified the need to expand coverage and utilize registries in cancer control, evaluation of interventions, and research. A report on the NCI Center for Global Health&#8217;s Inaugural Meeting (March 13-14,2012), <em>Setting Priorities for Global Cancer Research</em>, is expected in the fall 2012.

    DCCPS staff of the Applied Research Program (ARP) and Behavioral Research Program (BRP) attended the <a href="http://www.eurosfaire.prd.fr/7pc/documents/1332769467_icdam_8th_.pdf" >8th International Conference on Diet and Activity Methods (ICDAM 8)</a> <a href="/exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a> on May 14-17, 2012, in Rome, Italy. Amy Subar served on the planning committee, and others in ARP and BRP gave presentations, chaired sessions, and led workgroups on topics including assessment of food environments, new technologies for dietary assessment, dietary patterns and colorectal cancer incidence, cruciferous and green leafy vegetable intake and risk for premenopausal breast cancer, development and evaluation of the Healthy Eating Index - 2010, and several aspects of physical activity measurement. ICDAM is a leading conference that addresses methodological challenges for measuring diet and physical activity. This year, the conference theme focused on the methodological challenges for measuring the achievements of international policies. The conference was held at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which brought together many international scientists interested in monitoring changes in food consumption and physical activity patterns and in enhancing our understanding of the relationships between behaviors and health.</p>    
    
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;"><a name="3" id="3"></a>DCCPS Partners with China CDC on Folate Exposure Study</span><br />
    A follow-up study of a cohort that began in the 1990s involves collaboration among NCI&#8217;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences ( Nancy Potischman, David Berrigan, and Joseph Su), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics ( Martha Linet and Cari Kitahara), the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). The cohort includes women who were or were not exposed to folate during pregnancy, and their children. The original study found significantly fewer birth defects for the folate group. The follow-up study&#8217;s objectives are to examine the childhood cancer incidence and biological and other risk factors for adult cancers.</p>
    
    <p>Nancy Potischman conducted two trainings of 70 interviewers for the study. Investigators from the Nutrition Institute of the Chinese CDC participated in the trainings. They also trained lab personnel to process and store blood samples. Investigators from the newly formed National Center for Chronic Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention at the China CDC coordinated and participated in the trainings and helped produce the training and procedures manuals. Through these trainings, China CDC staff and the interviewers learned new skills related to diet and physical activity assessment, which will be useful for their future efforts to monitor the health-related activities of the population. In addition, the Nutrition Institute will learn the analytic techniques for Vitamin D and folic acid at the US CDC in Atlanta. Currently, diet, physical activity and ultraviolet radiation data on 120 mother-child pairs are being collected in two different sites in China.</p>

    <p>At the Cancer Prevention, Biomarkers and Screening Research in China and the United States workshop, US and Chinese experts in cancer prevention, biomarkers, and screening discussed the state of research on breast, cervical, lung, and esophageal cancers in their countries.  Pamela Marcus and Paul Doria-Rose participated heavily in the screening portion of the meeting. Each presented information on community-based screening in the US.  Dr. Marcus reported on primary care physicians&#8217; beliefs, practices, and recommendations about lung cancer screening and Dr. Doria-Rose reported on the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) and the Population-Based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) Initiative. As part of the meeting, Drs. Marcus and Doria-Rose participated in roundtable discussions that covered the most promising topics on which the two countries could collaborate. </p>
    
    <p>Brenda Edwards presented a talk on The Role of Cancer Surveillance and Registration in Cancer Screening Research and, with the Director of the Chinese Cancer Registry at CICAMS, co-moderated a &#34;roundtable&#34; session on cancer surveillance (quality of cancer registration and use for cancer prevention and control) as part of the workshop&#8217;s focus on funding opportunities of China-US collaborations (in the context of cancer prevention, screening research, and biomarker studies).  Dr. Edwards joined other members of the NCI Center for Global Health and senior members of CICAMS in meeting with Chinese leaders of their national, regional, and local cancer registry programs to learn about the infrastructure, expansion of the system, reporting and use of data in public health, policy, and research:  CICAMS Cancer Registry (for China); Beijing Cancer Hospital registry (a large cancer hospital that hosts the facility cancer registry and regional program for cancer control); and preliminary discussion with the director of the Shanghai Municipal Center for Cancer Control &#38; Prevention regarding operations, registry- centered research, statistical reporting and use of data, and opportunities/needs for knowledge transfer.  In addition, Dr. Edwards joined the NCI delegation from the Center for Global Health on their visit to the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (accompanied by the US CDC Director for China Non-communicable Disease [NCD] Activities) to be briefed on their emerging NCI program, which includes tobacco control.  The group traveled to Chengdu (Sichuan Province), made presentations on cancer control and on cancer surveillance data systems at an in-service conference on esophageal cancer organized by the Sichuan Cancer Center and had discussions regarding the Chinese cancer care delivery system in the western region.  Accompanied by the CICAMS directors of epidemiology and of the Chinese cancer registry, they participated in a site visit to the Peng-Xian county cancer registry in Le-Shan, with discussions on data flow and reporting.  A lunch visit was arranged for Drs. Trimble and Chao (NCI&#8217;s Global Center for Health) with the DHHS Health Attache in Beijing for preliminary discussions on implementation of the recent agreements for bilateral funded collaborative research.</p>
    
    <p>In preparation for the workshop, materials were provided on the US cancer surveillance federal programs (NCI SEER, CDC NPCR) and partners (ACS, NAACCR, CoC, NCRA) and made available through a US Chinese cancer web links.

     The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is working in partnership with several international, regional and national organizations to establish the Global Initiative for Cancer Registry (GICR) Development in Low- and Middle- Income Countries.  The GICR is implemented through &#34;hubs&#34; or IARC regional resource centers that provide technical and scientific support for population-based cancer registries and coordination of international research projects.  NCI, notably DCCPS and the Center for Global Health, are active participants in the GICR advisory committee and continue to explore opportunities for collaborations.  Surveillance Research Program communications interns (Hillary Hoffman and Heather Lasseter) are contributing to development of some materials. Recent discussions have focused on the feasibility of adapting the user interface between the powerful and widely used analytical tool SEER*Stat and the IARC open-source, population-based, cancer registration software CanReg.  Angela Mariotto, Hyunsoon Cho, Brenda Edwards, and Steve Scoppa from the DCCPS biomedical support contractor (Information Management Services, Inc.) are assessing the feasibility of streamlining the process of moving data from CanReg into SEER* Stat, defining a core set of international cancer registry data items, characterizing essential statistics for cancer registries, and clarifying the international community&#8217;s user needs.</p>

     Joan Warren is leading an ongoing collaboration with investigators in Ontario to examine end-of-life care, a clinical care arena that is documented to have wide variability in practice, quality, and associated costs. They are conducting studies on end-of-life care for lung cancer patients, comparing SEER-Medicare with Ontario&#8217;s claims data systems to examine patterns and the cost of end-of-life care. The Toronto investigators are from the University of Toronto, Toronto General Research Institute, Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences, and Toronto Regional Cancer Center. One paper has been published, and a second analysis, comparing cost of treatment, is in the final stages. Another collaboration with researchers at the University of Toronto is a case-control study of the effectiveness of colonoscopy in preventing colorectal cancer death, using SEER-Medicare data. This work was published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> on July 11, 2012.</p>
    
     <p><a name="20" id="20"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">Stigma Special Interest Group</span><br />
     DCCPS is actively involved in the Stigma Special Interest Group (SIG), a trans-NIH interest group whose purpose is to stimulate interdisciplinary research on stigma and health, including international research. The Stigma SIG was formed by the Center for Global Health in order to extend the efforts of the former Fogarty Stigma and Global Health Research Program. This program encouraged research to elucidate the etiology of stigma in relation to public health, as well as to develop and test interventions to mitigate the negative effects of stigma on health outcomes, and emphasized studies relevant to global health issues. The new Stigma SIG strives to extend the goals of this initiative.</p>
    
     <p><a name="21" id="21"></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #02561c;">China Smoking Cessation Program Using Text Messages</span><br />
     The goal of this project is to engage a combination of public and private partners to perform a an mhealth/text-based smoking cessation intervention demonstration project based on a country-specific modification of the QuitNowTXT library in China. This project will assist in determining the potential effectiveness and acceptability of a health-based SMS messaging program within China&#8217;s large population of smokers. If effective, text-based programs would provide a low-cost means to increase public education and knowledge on the harmful effects of smoking, and also to deliver a smoking cessation intervention. Mobile phone texting has the potential to be a powerful tool to help smokers quit smoking because it is widely available globally, inexpensive, and allows for immediate delivery of smoking cessation information.  In addition, this resource can be integrated into existing tobacco control strategies, thereby enhancing China&#8217;s ability to address the burden of tobacco use. Dr. Augustson recently traveled to China (July 2012) to facilitate this project moving forward.  While there he met with representatives of US CDC, US DHHS Health Liaison, China CDC, Chinese Center for Health Education, Nokia, and WHO.  Based on this meeting, the first phase of this project will begin in August and it is anticipated the main randomized controlled trial will launch by December 2012.</p>

     WHO is preparing to develop, publish, and disseminate a guideline on identification and management of tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use disorders in pregnant women, and other people living in the household.  WHO has a formal process for producing guidelines, and has received approval for moving forward with this project, which has been initiated by WHO in response to requests from organizations, institutions, and individuals for technical guidance on these subjects.  The planned guideline will be applicable to all WHO member states, including high-, middle-, and low-income countries, and provide an opportunity to focus the attention of governmental and non-governmental agencies on reduction of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure by pregnant women and their families.  WHO has requested both technical assistance and funding from NCI to assist in preparation of the tobacco portion of the guideline. Funds may be used for project management; consultants and technical experts to retrieve and review literature, produce summaries, and evidence tables; working group meetings; and production and dissemination of the final document.  NCI will provide funding and technical assistance, be involved in helping to select the Guideline Development Group, and assist with other tasks to be determined.</p>
