                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) experience significant health inequities and disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) related incidence, mortality, stage at diagnosis, and survival. Recent reductions in CRC incidence and mortality rates and improvements in stage at diagnosis and survival rates in the general U.S. population have been attributed to routine screening with prompt removal of polyps, early detection, and timely and appropriate treatment. AI/ANs are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive timely and risk- and age-appropriate cancer screenings, including recommended CRC screening. The short-term goal is to test the efficacy of serially implemented interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Serial implementation refers to offering routine screening, irrespective of response to an earlier invitation, in concordance with national guidelines which recommend annual FIT testing between ages 50-75. The FIT is most appropriate because, based on consensus guidelines, it is an approved, high sensitivity fecal occult blood test that is offered annually and is available in Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities where resources to provide screening colonoscopy are limited. We will follow all positive FIT results with timely and appropriate diagnostic and treatment services. We address screening disparities through the testing of interventions designed to enhance annual CRC screening using the FIT among average- risk, on-reservation AIs aged 50-75 in the rural Southwest. The interventions are theory-informed, evidence- based, and graded in their intensity. The high intensity intervention will include navigated outreach, a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 1). The medium intensity intervention will include a mailed FIT kit, educational material, and follow-up reminders (Study Group 2). The reference group (Study Group 3) will receive usual care (screening recommendation and a FIT kit at a clinic visit). We will use rigorous research methods to: (a) determine the efficacy of interventions to enhance annual CRC screening through completion of the FIT kit; (b) understand contextually relevant factors important for behavior change; (c) identify the most cost-effective strategies to enhance routine CRC screening; and (d) develop plans to inform sustainability and scalability. This is a collaborative effort between the University of New Mexico, the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board (100% Indian-owned and operated), and six Pueblo Tribes in the rural Southwest. The research team has an extensive and successful history of conducting community based participatory cancer prevention research in collaboration with AI communities. Moreover, the research team recognizes the value of integrating a co-learning process and engaging in trust-based mutually beneficial research. Findings from this research could lead to an immediate increase in CRC screening and ultimately reduce the CRC disease burden among AIs experiencing cancer disparities and health inequities.</p></div>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developing effective tobacco cessation  interventions during pregnancy for American Indian and Alaska Native people is  a national priority and will contribute to the U.S. public health objective of  reducing tobacco- related health disparities. In the southwest region of Alaska  where the proposed project will take place, 79% of Alaska Native women smoke  cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco (ST) during pregnancy. In addition,  pregnancy appears to be a high risk period for initiation of tobacco use,  primarily ST, among women reporting no use of tobacco 3 months before  pregnancy. Our pilot study suggested that an individual-based intervention  delivered at the first prenatal visit had low reach to pregnant women and poor  tobacco abstinence rates. Intervention efforts targeting the entire community,  not only pregnant women, to address social norms about tobacco use may be more  effective. Thus, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of a novel,  multi-component, theory-based intervention for reducing tobacco use during  pregnancy, incorporating both individually targeted and community level  components delivered by female elders &quot;Native Sisters.&quot; The  intervention builds on effective community and individual-based approaches for  tobacco cessation and lay health advisor approaches for cancer prevention among  Native American women. As part of the intervention, a social marketing campaign  including digital stories and other small media will be developed with  community feedback. Individually targeted components will be six 30-40 minute  telephone or home-based peer counseling sessions with pregnant women. This R01 project is submitted in response to  PAR-11-346. It will be conducted in two phases. All aspects of the project will  be guided by a community advisory committee. In Phase I, we will develop the  social marketing components by obtaining qualitative feedback from pregnant  women, family members and elders on message content and delivery channels. In  Phase II, we will evaluate the intervention using a group- randomized design  with village as the unit of assignment. Sixteen villages will be randomly  assigned to receive the intervention or control condition (usual care), with  &gt; 20 women enrolled from each village. Enrollment will occur at the time of  a positive pregnancy test which is the earliest point of prenatal care,  enhancing the intervention's potential reach. Both tobacco users and non-users  will be eligible because many start to use during pregnancy. Assessments will  be completed by enrolled women through 6 months postpartum. We will evaluate  the efficacy of the intervention compared with the control condition on the  biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence tobacco use rate at week 36  gestation and at 6 months postpartum. We will also examine the effect of the  intervention on proposed social cognitive-theory based mediators of change  including perceived self-efficacy for non-tobacco use and anti-tobacco norms.  Our long term objective is to determine effective interventions for Alaska  Native women that will ultimately reduce the risk of tobacco-related maternal,  fetal, and infant adverse health outcomes.</p>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by  applicant): American Indian tribal  college students have the highest smoking rates of any racial/ethnic group in  the young adult population and also are disproportionately burdened by smoking-related  morbidity and mortality. There are very few effective culturally-tailored  smoking cessation programs for AI smokers. Our research group has worked with  the American Indian community for the past 8 years to develop a  culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (All Nations Breath of Life -  ANBL), for AI adult smokers. All Nations Breath of Life was developed using the  community-based participatory research approach and is an in-person group based  program that incorporates cultural issues throughout the program. We have  produced 30% cessation rates at 6-month follow-up with adult American Indian  smokers from tribes and nations in the Midwest. Due to limited studies with the  tribal college population, we have already conducted a cross-sectional  internet-based survey to collect information on their smoking behaviors as well  as other health behaviors. This research experience and strong collaboration  with the AI community leaves us well poised to adapt the ANBL program for the  tribal college smoking population. However, this current program needs  substantial modifications to meet the unique needs of the tribal college  student population. It recognizes the sacred role of tobacco among many  American Indians and how culture affects smoking cessation among AIs, while  still addressing recreational smoking. However, preliminary data from our  recent studies indicate that the internet may be more favorable and appropriate  delivery method for reaching this younger and more mobile tribal college  population due to the web interactivity, immediacy of feedback, and wide reach  and accessibility. This current proposal reflects a natural progression to  addressing the significant problem of smoking among tribal college students  using our successful methods. In this study, we will adapt and test a  culturally tailored internet-based smoking cessation (I-ANBL) program based on  ANBL, which was developed through CBPR methods. For the current proposal, we  will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (N=242) to test the  effectiveness of an internet-based, culturally tailored smoking cessation  program (I-ANBL) in a tribal college student population. Data will be collected  at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using salivary cotinine, as well as  comprehensive set of environmental and psychosocial measures. We hypothesize  that AI tribal college students randomized to the culturally-tailored smoking  cessation internet arm (I-ANBL) will have significantly higher continuous  abstinence rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet  intervention (I-FV), focusing on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. We  will also examine the costs of delivering the tailored intervention program and  potential mediators and moderators of the intervention-cessation relationship.  Such a high-reach, low-cost strategy for promoting smoking cessation in this  at-risk and underserved population could have great potential for adoption on a  larger scale and thus help reduce existing health disparities. </p>

                      DESCRIPTION (provided by  applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN), and AI/AN have worse lung cancer incidence rates, survival, and death compared to the general population. Because lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality by roughly 20%, the United States Preventive Services Task Force now recommends LCS for men and women aged 55-80 years who meet specific eligibility criteria (grade-B evidence), and subsequently the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) opted to cover this test. However, the uptake of LCS implementation has been slow in most healthcare systems, and LCS implementation among AI/AN has never been studied. To address this knowledge and implementation gap, we prose the “Tribally Engaged Approaches to Lung Screening (TEALS)” study, which is a collaborative effort between the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, the Stephenson Cancer Center, and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center that directly addresses the low uptake of LCS in tribal settings through the development of a theory-driven LCS implementation program within the Choctaw Nation Health Services Authority (CNHSA). Over the course of 5 years, TEALS will: 1) Conduct focus groups and semi-structured interviews with CNHSA patients, clinicians, and health administrators to elucidate individual- and system-level barriers and facilitators that affect the implementation of LCS; 2) Develop, and iteratively refine an LCS care coordination intervention that will identify eligible persons for LCS, help these patients navigate the screening process, and link them with smoking cessation services, when applicable; 3) Measure the impact of the TEALS intervention on the receipt of screening and a set of patient- and practice-level outcomes by conducting a cluster-randomized clinical trial of LCS implementation; and 4) Disseminate the TEALS program to other researchers and healthcare systems that serve AI/AN patients. TEALS will bridge the gap between evidence and clinical practice for LCS in a high- need, low-resource setting by intervening at the level of the healthcare system. System-level interventions for guideline implementation tend to be understudied compared to those evaluating individual-level, behavioral interventions. However, the careful development and evaluation of an LCS screening program at the level of the healthcare system would be critical to ensure that more patients can receive LCS when appropriate. Through TEALS, our research will create a critically needed platform from which future studies could be launched that will examine how to tailor the application of the LCS guideline to the individual preferences of AI/AN patients. TEALS will establish an effective LCS program in a tribal system and thus provide a direct benefit to the Choctaw Nation by increasing LCS participation. TEALS will serve as a blueprint for establishing a sustainable and accessible infrastructure for LCS in AI/AN and other community health systems. By increasing screening for early stage lung cancer, TEALS could ultimately reduce lung cancer mortality in AI/AN communities, many of which are in great need of effective strategies to reduce longstanding cancer disparities.

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Food  insecurity increases one's risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer  (via its links to poor diet and nutrition), conditions highly prevalent among  Native Americans in Oklahoma (obesity 42%, diabetes 15%, and hypertension  38%).1 Our pilot study shows that 3 times as many Natives in Oklahoma are food  insecure as Whites (21.3% vs. 7.3% respectively).2 Yet few or no studies have  assessed individual- and environmental-level correlates of food insecurity  among Natives and none have developed interventions or broad-based educational  materials within Oklahoma tribal nations.3,4 Aims and Methods: This study, led  by a Native American Choctaw Investigator will, Aim #1: Assess correlates  (sociodemographics, health behaviors, perceived food environment) and outcomes  (dietary intake including vegetables and fruits, BMI, diabetes, and  hypertension) of food insecurity in the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations in  Oklahoma. A telephone survey will be administered to 500 Native American adults  (18+) randomly sampled from tribal registries. Clinical measures will be  validated for 200 of those surveyed using tribal clinic electronic healt  records. Perceptions of food environments will be compared to objective store  measures using GIS data. Aim #2: Design, implement, and evaluate a convenience  store intervention to increase the availability and intake of vegetables and  fruits among tribal members. Using a cluster-randomized design with 20 matched  tribally owned convenience stores (5 cases and 5 controls in each tribe), we  will implement evidence-based strategies (increased availability and variety,  point of purchase information, reduced prices/coupons) to increase the sales  and intake of vegetables and fruits among tribal members. Store-level changes  will be measured by pre/post sales records and the Nutrition Environment  Measures Survey; individual-level changes by two cross-sectional surveys,  administered to 300 convenience store shoppers before and 300 shoppers after  the intervention. Tribal members will use video voice,3 an action-oriented  participatory media research method to collect qualitative and environmental  data (e.g. types of foods/beverages sold and promoted in the convenience  stores) to facilitate community planning and channel recommendations to policy  makers. Aim #3: Create a multimedia manual, co-developed with tribal members,  guiding tribes in food environment changes, and disseminated over a free and  open source Website allowing for tribal user- created content. Innovation: Each  of the 3 aims builds on our preliminary data and/or best practices, and  leverages tribal resources and partnerships to enhance survey participation  rates and convenience store &quot;healthy makeovers.&quot; Significance and  Impact: The knowledge from surveys on food insecurity correlates and health  outcomes will inform the design of the convenience store intervention to increase  availability of vegetables and fruits. The resulting multimedia manual will  guide food environment changes among tribes nationally to address the  critically high rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension within this  population.</p>

                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) the proposed research  will evaluate the efficacy of two culturally tailored, technology-mediated  disease prevention interventions for supporting change in multiple risk  behaviors in rural Alaska Native (AN) men and women. Directly informed by the  research team's fieldwork over the past 6 years in rural Alaska, continued  community partnership with the tribes, and ethnographic research, the  interventions will be tailored to AN health needs and values to target 5 of the  American Heart Association's 7 Strategic Impact Goals for 2020. In a randomized controlled 2-group design,  the trial will compare two active treatment conditions: Group 1 targets tobacco  and physical activity; Group 2 targets control of hypertension and  hypercholesterolemia (HTN-HCL) through medication adherence and nutritional  changes. Both conditions utilize trans theoretical model-tailored, computerized  interventions, delivered via telemedicine by Indigenous-focused counselors  located in Anchorage reaching AN people in their rural home villages.  Computerized intervention contacts occur at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months with  final assessment at 18-months. Study design provides an equivalent contact time  and technology comparison; facilitates individual-level randomization within  communities, as all participants receive highly individualized counseling and  intervention materials; and allows for comparison of traditional risk factor  (HTN-HCL) versus risk behavior (tobacco/ physical activity) interventions.  Participants (N=300) will be daily smokers with at least one additional  cardiovascular disease risk factor (e.g., inactivity, overweight, HTN, HCL) or  established vascular disease. The trial aims to reach AN people regardless of  residential location or intention to change.  The primary hypothesis is that Group 1 will achieve significantly  greater biochemically- confirmed tobacco abstinence than Group 2 through  18-months follow-up and secondarily will significantly increase their physical  activity. Secondary hypotheses are that Group 2 will achieve significantly  greater control of HTN and HCL than Group 1 through (i) medication compliance  and (ii) dietary change. Tertiary aims will: (a) compare the interventions on  overall behavior change; (b) model cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of  each intervention; and (c) examine moderators/mediators of treatment outcome,  including the trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio, a noninvasive measure  of nicotine metabolism rate. The proposal combines technology, pharmacology,  behavioral science, and health economics for advancing the health of AN people  who face significant health disparities with limited access to interventions  given their isolated geographics.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) are  experiencing an epidemic of stroke morbidity and mortality, with higher  prevalence and incidence, younger age at onset, and poorer survival than other  racial and ethnic groups. With a stroke incidence more than twice that of the  general U.S. population, stroke in AIs is a public health problem of staggering  scope. AIs also have disproportionate burdens of many risk factors for stroke,  including hypertension, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. However, no rigorous,  population-based studies of stroke prevention have included AIs. Tribes  urgently need evidence-based methods for preventing stroke that minimize clinic  visits and lab tests and use affordably measured endpoints. One such endpoint  is a stroke risk score. We developed a 10-year stroke risk score for AIs using  data from the Strong Heart Study, a large, population-based cohort of 4,549 AIs  from 12 tribes in Arizona, Oklahoma, and the Dakotas. We propose to address the  need for effective, affordable, and sustainable stroke prevention methods in  participants in the Strong Heart Family Study. This study collected  family-cluster data on cardiovascular disease risk factors from 3,800 AIs based  on 94 randomly selected index participants from the Strong Heart Study. With  our partners, we have designed the &quot;Family Intervention in the Spirit of  Motivational Interviewing&quot; (FITSMI), a program delivered at the household  level to encourage lifestyle changes that transform the home environment and  reduce stroke risk for all residents. FITSMI uses a &quot;talking circle&quot;  format in which facilitators guide participants to identify goals for change  and create a tailored plan for sustainable implementation that may target  smoking, exercise, diet, or medication adherence. FITSMI requires just 2  sessions (baseline and 1 month post-baseline), with text messaging used to  boost long-term adherence. In a group-randomized trial design, we will recruit  360 households where Strong Heart Family Study members aged 45 and older  reside. We will assign half to FITSMI and half to a control condition that  receives educational brochures. All household residents e 11 years old will be  eligible. Primary outcomes are household-level improvement in stroke risk score  for adult's e 45 years old, and selected modifiable risk factors for all  participants. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the effectivenes of FITSMI in  AIs e 45 years old to lower stroke risk scores from baseline to 1-year  follow-up, with coronary heart disease risk scores evaluated as a secondary  outcome; and 2) Determine the effectiveness of FITSMI to improve individual  modifiable stroke risk factors (e.g., smoking, blood pressure) in all household  members e 11 years old from baseline to 1-year follow-up. This effort is  aligned with an Institute of Medicine report recommending a shift from  provider- and clinic-centered healthcare to &quot;care based on continuous  healing relationships.&quot; FITSMI is designed to facilitate adoption of  healthy lifestyles to prevent stroke and improve cardiovascular health. If  proven effective, FITSMI has broad, multigenerational public health  implications for prevention of stroke and cardiovascular disease in AI and  non-AI populations. </p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                          Native Hawaiians (NH) have higher rates of chronic diseases, such  as cardiovascular disease<br>
(CVD), diabetes, and cancer. Hypertension (HTN), an important  modifiable risk factor for CVD,<br>
is  70% higher in Native Hawaiians (NH) than in Whites. In fact, NH are 3-4 times  more likely to develop CVD conditions, such as stroke and coronary heart  disease, and at a younger age. In addition to prescribed medication,  improvements in HTN can be achieved through increased physical activity (PA)  and self-management education (e.g. stress management, reduces sodium intake,  weight-loss, and smoking cessation). Yet, many commonly prescribed PA, such as  jogging and use of treadmills, are difficult for NH to initiate and maintain  because of socioeconomic barriers and lack of alignment with NH preferred modes  of living and cultural values (i.e. familial interdependence, group-based PA,  cultural PA). This proposed research uses hula, the traditional dance form of  NH and hallmark of NH culture, as the PA basis for a culturally relevant and  sustainable CVD prevention program targeting HTN management. Hula training is  popular, not only Hawai'i, but across the U.S. through the 784 hālau hula (hula  schools) found in most States. Using a community-based participatory research  (CBPR) framework, a hula-based CVD health intervention was strongly endorsed by  Kumu hula (hula experts and guardians of hula traditions), NH individuals, and  communities. Further, hula training was determined to yield metabolic  equivalent of energy expenditure as a moderate and vigorous intensity PA. Data  from our pilot CBPR randomized control trial (RCT) study found that 60 minutes  of hula training twice a week for 12 weeks reduced systolic blood pressure (BP)  by 7.5 mmHg (SD=16.5) more than the control group, but the long-term effects  were mixed and the study did not assess CVD risk. Interestingly, the pilot  intervention also improved social functioning, reduced physical pain, and  perceived racial discrimination, suggesting a possible psychosocial and  socio-cultural mechanism by which the intervention affects BP. In this  application we offer a CBPR guided RCT of 250 NH with physician-diagnosed HTN  in Hawai'i and Washington State. We will compare the effects of a 6-month  intervention that combines hula training and brief culturally-tailored HTN  self-management education delivered by peer educators and Kumu hula to a  wait-list control group in reducing systolic BP and CVD risk scores. We will  also determine the mediating effects of health behaviors (e.g., smoking), self-regulation,  psychosocial (e.g., social support), and socio-cultural factors (e.g.,  perceived racism) on blood pressure reduction. Our goal is to build on the  existing widespread infrastructure of hālau hula and NH organizations to  deliver a sustainable, culturally-preferred CVD prevention program.</p></div>

                          American Indian (AI)  populations experience disproportionately high rates of obesity and related  chronic diseases (CD). Intervention trials aimed at modifying the food  environment in AI communities have shown positive results, such as increasing  the purchase and consumption of healthy foods. The current challenge is to  facilitate the development of evidence-based policies in order to improve the  sustainability of environmental interventions. The primary goal of the proposed  research is to improve the food and physical activity (PA) environments in AI  communities at multiple levels (worksites, schools, food stores) by working in  partnership with tribal leaders to enact policies and programs that aim to  reduce CDs. We will achieve this goal by developing, implementing, and  evaluating a randomized controlled community-based trial which is supported or  implemented by tribal leaders through policy. The study will take place in six  AI communities located in Wisconsin and New Mexico. This project builds  directly on our previous successful work in five AI communities where we  conducted a multilevel obesity prevention trial (OPREVENT) targeting food  stores, worksites and schools. This proposed trial (OPREVENT2) complements and  expands upon the previous one, by fostering the development of relevant  policies among tribal leaders which is key for sustainability. <br>
The <strong>specific aims </strong>of OPREVENT2 are: 1) To conduct formative research to  describe tribal policy development and enactment in participating AI  communities, in order to support tribal health policy makers to identify  effective policies to sustain obesity and chronic disease prevention/reduction  programs, by building capacity and collaborative partnerships; 2) To develop a  community-based CD prevention program for AI communities informed by our  earlier trials, formative research from Aim 1 and best-practices from the  scientific literature; an 3) To evaluate the impact of the CD related policies  and programs on adiposity, psychosocial factors and obesity risk behaviors,  including dietary quality (e.g., fruit and vegetable servings),nutrient intake,  and PA in a community- randomized controlled trial. The proposed study directly  addresses NIH PAR-11-346 priorities by developing and testing an innovative  multilevel obesity prevention strategy in AI communities that combines  supportive policy with a culturally appropriate multilevel intervention. The  proposed study is also locally generated and, therefore, more likely to be  self-sustaining. We expect to impact the following areas of interest to the  PAR: engagement of tribal leaders in developing and implementing CD policy, development  of culturally appropriate community-based CD prevention programs, and increased  availability of healthy foods, improvements in diet and PA, and reductions in  adiposity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                          DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension, also called high blood pressure (BP), is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Nearly one-third of all U.S. adults have hypertension, but only half of these cases are successfully controlled by medication or diet. The negative public health consequences are profound. American Indians (AIs) have disproportionate CVD morbidity and mortality, and they have higher burdens of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking than other races. Yet AIs are rarely represented in national studies on hypertension management. Most interventions targeting CVD have focused on reservation-based AIs, even though 71% of AIs live in urban areas. This urban population is an invisible minority, with high rates of disease and disability, and low rates of healthcare usage. Medication alone is suboptimal for controlling BP; a heart-healthy diet is preferable. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a high-impact lifestyle intervention for primary and secondary prevention of CVD that centers on a low-salt, low-fat diet emphasizing fresh fruits and vegetables. In a randomized trial, the DASH diet lowered systolic BP by 11.5 mm Hg in participants with clinical hypertension. However, the DASH diet never been tested in AIs. We therefore designed an 8-week DASH intervention to improve BP control in hypertensive urban AIs. Our  American Indian Five Nuts and Beans Project  (AI-5) includes culturally tailored DASH education that emphasizes low sodium intake, traditional Native foods, and maintaining healthy eating habits, plus a $30 weekly credit for home delivery of groceries that meet DASH guidelines. Home delivery is a creative solution to logistical barriers, such as limited access to fresh produce, that often deter residents of poor urban neighborhoods from maintaining a healthy diet. The control condition will receive printed educational materials and a $30 weekly credit for grocery delivery, with no purchasing restrictions. Our randomized trial will test AI-5 i a total of 400 adult AIs with inadequately controlled systolic BP (140-159 mmHg). We will recruit and randomize 200 participants from each of 2 urban clinics: one in Spokane, WA, the other in Oklahoma City, OK. Our primary outcome is systolic BP measured after the 8-week intervention and again 12 weeks later. Secondary outcomes are other modifiable CVD risk factors, risk scores for heart disease and stroke, and dietary habits. We will also conduct an embedded pilot study to inform future research on long-term sustainability and impact. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) evaluate the effect of the AI-5 intervention on BP and secondary outcomes in adult AIs with poorly controlled hypertension, and 2) conduct a pilot study among 100 intervention participants after the intervention concludes by randomizing half to receive 6 weeks of dietician support (pilot intervention) and the other half to receive no further support (pilot control). We will collect BP data at 6 and 9 months post-baseline. This approach will have important public health implications and will inform efforts to export interventions for CVD and hypertension to other urban and rural AI groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing intake of salt and fats can prevent cardiovascular disease and further the goals of Healthy People 2020. Sustainable, cost-effective dietary interventions are needed for high-risk populations such as urban American Indians. Our study adapts an existing heart-healthy diet for American Indians with high blood pressure, answering the American Heart Association's call for interventions that address household dietary practices.

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American  Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth report higher rates of alcohol and drug  (AOD) use, greater frequency and intensity of AOD use, earlier first AOD use,  and much higher alcohol-related mortality than other racial/ethnic groups in  the U.S. Data regarding urban AIs/ANs are limited; however, one study found  that at-risk AIs/AN adults in an urban setting report an earlier onset of  alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, and other drug use compared to all other  ethnic/racial groups within LA County. This proposal responds to PAR-11-346,  Interventions for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Native American  Populations, which is focused on developing, adapting, and testing the  effectiveness of health promotion prevention interventions in Native American  populations. The two Co-PIs provide a unique blend of expertise that has  resulted in the development of an innovative preliminary protocol for AI/AN  youth: Motivational Interviewing and Culture for Urban Native American Youth  (MICUNAY), which integrates traditional healing approaches with motivational  interviewing (MI). Dickerson is an Alaska Native (Inupiaq) new investigator who  worked with the AI/AN community to obtain community-based perspectives on  decreasing AOD use and mental health problems. D'Amico is internationally  recognized for her work focused on the development and testing of MI  interventions targeting AOD use for culturally diverse adolescents across  different settings. Dickerson and colleagues have demonstrated the need for  culturally-appropriate interventions for AI/AN youth. His two community-based  projects found that there is a lack of programs integrating tradition-based  healing with evidenced based treatments (EBTs), and this was cited as a significant  barrier to seeking care within urban AI/AN populations. Therefore, MICUNAY will  integrate tradition-based healing with MI. It consists of 6 weekly 1-hour  sessions (3 MI AOD sessions and 3 tradition activity sessions). Our proposal  also incorporates a multi-system intervention approach. At the individual  level, we will provide MICUNAY to urban AI/AN youth. At the community level, we  will discuss AOD use and AOD prevention among AI/AN youth at existing Community  Wellness Gatherings (CWG). The proposed 5-year study will consist of two main  components: 1) A Developmental Phase in which we conduct focus groups across  two clinical sites in Los Angeles and Oakland with the community to establish  feasibility and sustainability of delivery, 2) A randomized controlled tria  comparing youth who only attend a CWG (n=100) to youth who attend a CWG plus  receive MICUNAY (n=100). We will compare outcomes at 3- and 6-month follow-up  to determine (a) whether clinically significant changes in AOD expectancies,  perceived prevalence of peer AOD use, alcohol consumption, marijuana and other  drug use, and related consequences occur; (b) whether clinically significant  changes in physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being a well as  spirituality and cultural identification occur, and (c) if reductions occur,  estimate effec sizes for the CWG group and the CWG plus MICUNAY group. Our  study substantially extends work with AI/AN youth by intervening at both the  community and individual level, and developing and testing an integrated  tradition-based AOD MI group intervention for urban AI/AN youth.                    </p>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research  fulfills the NIAAA's mission to address health disparities by reducing alcohol  use and improving academic outcomes in a high-risk population of American  Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Tribal College and University (TCU) students  through implementation and evaluation of a low cost screening and brief  intervention (SBI). The Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College  Students (BASICS), an SBI pioneered and tested by UW investigators on this  study, represents a cost effective means to reduce alcohol use. A college-  level intervention for policy and systems change will also be tested aimed at:  (1) instituting a harm reduction policy that supports a shift from zero  tolerance alcohol policies, (2) integrating behavioral health resources for the  benefit of high-risk TCU students, and, (3) ensuring TCU SBI implementation  fidelity. BASICS has reduced alcohol consumption and consequences in mainstream  colleges and this proposal would, using a Community- based Participatory  Research approach, provide a cultural contextualization of BASICS and test this  intervention for the first time in AIAN TCU students. The specific aims are to  adapt, manualize and implement a culturally contextualized version of BASICS:  (a) To test whether a culturally appropriate BASICS intervention will surpass a  wait list control condition by significantly reducing indices of hazardous or  harmful drinking and alcohol-related negative consequences; (b) To test the  effect of the intervention in significantly improving retention and academic  performance among TCU students; and, (2) Implement a system-level policy  intervention moving from zero-tolerance to harm reduction policies at the  college-level and providing capacity to integrate services for improved  referral and treatment for high risk TCU students to test whether an  environmental approach will positively impact the SBI intervention and its  outcomes. This study's primary hypothesis is that a culturally contextualized  adaptation of SBI, as identified by the TCU/AIHEC/UW partnership, will surpass  a wait list control condition in reducing hazardous or harmful drinking and  alcohol- related negative consequences and improve academic outcomes, with a  significantly greater effect in TCU with the policy intervention.               	  </p>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
   		        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past 10 years we have focused on addressing two interrelated public health issues, alcohol use disorder (AUD) and suicide in 12-18 year old Yup'ik Alaska Natives (AN). AUD and suicide are among the leading causes of mortality among AN people and a significant health disparity in contrast to the U.S. general population (1). AN mortality rates from all alcohol-induced disorders between 2001 2005 were 53.8/100,000 in contrast to 6.3/100,000 for other ethnic groups in Alaska (2), while the age-adjusted rate for suicide is twice the national average (3). Overall, between 1960-95 AN suicide rates increased approximately 500% (4). More recent data indicate continuation of these trends and also identify cluster suicide behavior as a feature of AN youth suicide (5). Yup'ik community leaders have made addressing AUD and suicide among their highest priorities. In response, working with several communities, a community-based and led intervention (Qungasvik - toolbox) was designed. The intervention is designed to develop protective factors that will ultimately reduce the incidence of AUD and suicide. Our research leading up to the currently proposed study has shown that it is possible to: (1) deliver the intervention in remote rural communities; (2) obtain valid and reliable measures of two ultimate outcomes (i.e., Reflective Processes regarding alcohol consequences and Reasons for Life) and intermediate protective factors variables that underlie them; (3) show a dose-response effect: the more intervention sessions a person attends (dose) the stronger the measured protective factors (response); and (4) obtain a maximum protective effect from the intervention by lengthening the duration of the intervention from one to two years. The proposed study is an assessment of a modified version of the intervention and focuses on three specific aims (SA): (SA1) test Qungasvik intervention efficacy through impact on the two protective factors and to link those measures to direct measures of alcohol use and suicidal ideation; (SA2) examine the mechanisms of change in response to the intervention through growth in: (a) intermediate outcome measures of protective factors at the individual, family, peer, and community level; (b) social network characteristics of supportive relationships with elders, immediate and extended kinship relations, and community adults and describe social network change; and (c) using qualitative interviewing and grounded theory analysis techniques, describe process and impact of the intervention from community elder and parent perspectives; and (SA3) examine the fidelity of implementing the intervention.</p></div>

               		    The  goal of this research program is to implement and evaluate complementary  interventions designed to address underage alcohol, marijuana, tobacco and  other drug use and abuse among Native American youth residing in and around  nine contiguous Indian reservations in rural San Diego County. The application  directly builds upon the successful collaboration between a Southern California  Tribal Health Clinic, PIRE's Prevention Research Center, and The Scripps  Research Institute, with pilot and demonstration studies focusing on reducing  the supply of and demand for alcohol by Native American youth through a series  of environmental and individual interventions that have shown efficacy and have  gained acceptability in the communities served by the clinics. The overall goal  of the present proposal will be accomplished through two complementary efforts,  one aimed at the community (supply) level and the other at the individual  (demand) level. The community-based environmental prevention program will focus  on reducing underage access through tailoring, implementing and evaluating a  community mobilization and awareness intervention aimed at reducing the social  availability of alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and other drugs from adults,  including family members. These community -level programs will be complemented  with interventions at the individual level, including implementing and  evaluating a culturally tailored motivational interviewing brief intervention  to reduce demand for alcohol and other drugs for American Indian youth 13- 20  years of age who are substance users. We will evaluate the effectiveness  of these programs by analyzing multiple data sources: (a) outcome data from a  Motivational Interviewing-Psychoeducation trial among tribal youth, (b) data  from school and community youth surveys on youths&rsquo; self -reported substance use  and related problems including driving under the influence, (c) anonymous norms  and intervention awareness surveys from adults from each of the communities;  and (d) law enforcement data on alcohol/drug-related events. For the purposes  of evaluation, these data from the Indian Health Council catchment area will be  compared to data from surveys of both non-Native and Native American youth who  were not involved in the intervention activities. The research will continue to  build cohorts of expert Native American research staff and student interns for  actualizing the research and interventions. The team will create intervention  workbooks for standardized application of the intervention techniques in other  Native American communities.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                         Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) result in neurodevelopmental deficits and lifelong disability; they are a leading cause of preventable birth defects in the U.S. According to the CDC, any sexually active woman of reproductive age who drinks alcohol and does not use effective contraception is at risk for an alcohol exposed pregnancy (AEP) that could cause FASD. By this definition, American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) young women are especially vulnerable to AEP, with high levels of alcohol consumption and sexual risk taking compared to their counterparts in other race/ethnic groups. Although an estimated 72% of AIAN young women live in urban areas, very little research has yet included them; urban AIAN needs are often ignored in research aimed at developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally appropriate services. Recent research indicates that mobile health (mHealth) interventions may offer a promising mechanism for delivering effective interventions to hard-to-reach populations. The goal of this project is to expand reach and services to urban AIAN young women through mHealth technology to prevent AEP and FASD. The proposed project builds on a prior NIAAA-funded project which used intensive community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to adapt CHOICES, an evidence-based brief AEP intervention supported by the CDC, to American Indian Youth CHOICES (AIY-C). AIY-C contains features that make it highly amenable to mHealth approaches, including a framework for integrating diverse cultural teachings, few modules of short duration, and concrete opportunities for goal-setting and achievement. Innovative for this population is the plan to recruit young AIAN women from major urban areas in the US through social media—and to deliver AIY-C via mobile devices, increasingly ubiquitous among AIAN young adults. While social media recruitment and mHealth interventions are not new, only very recently have they been used with AIAN populations. We will partner with urban AIAN organizations to guide us through social media recruitment strategies, mHealth intervention translation and implementation, and evaluation in urban AIAN settings. We propose 3 specific aims: (1) Develop and pilot social-media-based recruitment strategies for urban AIAN young women; (2) translate AIY-C for mHealth delivery through an iterative and theoretically driven process and pilot the developed translated mHealth AIY-C intervention; and (3) recruit 700 (final N=525) urban AIAN young women using identified social media strategies, and conduct an RCT to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the mHealth translation of AIY-C for preventing AEP and FASD. The proposed project promises expansive reach to AIAN young women to address significant yet preventable public health concerns – AEP and FASD; importantly, the project also promises to advance a blueprint for preventive intervention research with urban AIAN populations largely ignored to date.</p>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problematic  substance use is widespread in many American Indian communities, and early  adolescence is a critical period for the development of subsequent substance  problems. Efforts to prevent early substance abuse are ongoing on many  reservations but often are not informed by scientific evidence of effectiveness  - largely because such evidence is sorely lacking. We propose to partner with a  reservation community with high rates of substance problems to adapt,  implement, and rigorously evaluate a program designed to prevent early  initiation of substance use and the myriad of problems that accompany early  use. The identification of early substance use as a target and the selection of  the particular intervention approach we propose have directly resulted from a  longstanding university-tribal community relationship and, in particular, from  community input within the context of two recent projects funded by NIDA  (RC4DA029974, Whitesell &amp; Beals, PIs; and R01DA027665, Whitesell, PI). A  clear message arising out of both projects has been the need to engage families  and culture in the prevention of early onset substance use. In this project, we  will continue this partnership to translate a rigorously evaluated  evidence-based practice for use with tribal families, adapting and anchoring it  within a cultural practice arising from within the community. We will draw on  the strengths of both university and community partners, implementing  innovative intervention development methods within a community collaborative  research and evaluation context. We will address three specific aims: 1.  Develop a culturally grounded, family-based early substance use prevention intervention  tailored to a Northern Plains American Indian Reservation. &quot;Use an evidence-based practice approach  to implement a proven program (Iowa Strengthening Families Program/ISFP) within a new context,  working with community partners to translate ISFP for the local context, including deep and  meaningful adaptations in how the curricular content is delivered. &quot;Use a practice-based evidence approach  to integrate a cultural curriculum (Seven Directions/SD) developed within the community into the ISFP  curriculum, drawing on local knowledge of effective practices to further ground substance use  prevention efforts within the cultural context. 2. Pilot the adapted Seven  Directions for Stronger Families (SDSF) program to determine feasibility,  refine details, and maximize fit within  the community. 3. Use the principles of the Multiphase Optimization Strategy  (MOST) for intervention evaluation and  development, to determine the relative effect size of different  intervention components and inform a final  SDSF program that balances effectiveness and efficiency. 4. Set the  stage for broad implementation of SDSF by the tribal health administration and  a randomized controlled trial of the  full intervention. </p>                                                   </div>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inhalants pose a  particularly dangerous risk to middle-school youth, and American Indian (AI)  youth are at particular risk for inhalant use. We have found over the course of  more than three decades that inhalant use among AI youth is consistently higher  than that of other ethnic/racial groups. Although inhalant use rates for AI  youth gradually declined from a peak of 31% in 1984 through 2004, our data show  a substantial increase in lifetime prevalence of inhalants among AI 7th - 12th  grade youth -- from 10% to 25%. Schools  are often the site for adolescent drug prevention efforts, but results from  these efforts are often modest or even disappointing. This intervention adapts  an existing campaign (Be under Your Own Influence; BUYOI) that has been found  to be effective in reducing substance use and that uses campaign messages that  are congruent with AI culture. The intervention will be adapted using  significant contributions from tribal members, including youth, teachers,  parents, elders, and other community members. This proposal includes active  involvement of local advisory boards, hiring of a local AI liaison, focus  groups, a youth photo voice component, and use of AI staff from our Center and  from the Native American Cultural Center at our university. The adapted anti-inhalant communications  campaign will be delivered by selected high school students to 7th grade  students. A distinguishing feature of the BUYOI campaign is a message that  targets outcome expectations related to aspirations, autonomy, and physical  harms. The campaign will use multiple channels of communication including print  (e.g., posters and fliers), video and audio spots, presentations, and social  media to deliver messages that are designed to alter outcome expectancies,  intentions, and ultimately inhalant use among targeted youth. The campaign will be delivered to two cohorts  of 7th graders, with 4 longitudinal measurement occasions for each cohort.  Seven middle schools (and their corresponding high schools) have been recruited  for the study, where four of these will be randomly assigned to the  intervention condition and three to the control condition. Multilevel data  analysis will test for effects of campaign exposure on autonomy, aspirations,  perceived harm, and intentions to use.  Because of the heavy involvement of the school and community in the  development and delivery of the intervention, we will be able to incorporate  sustainability into the design of all integrated components. Ultimately, our  goal is to develop a turnkey package for the broader population of  reservation-based AI youth and schools and to develop components that can  incorporate flexibility and creativity in their delivery. For example, a school  or local group may implement the campaign in its original form or they may  modify aspects to make them more pertinent to their community.               	  </p>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse among American  Indians (AI) is a critical health disparity and accounts for many life-  threatening and deadly problems such as accidents, chronic liver disease,  cirrhosis, homicide, and suicide. The high rate of substance abuse found among  AI adolescents is believed to be associated with a variety of environmental and  historical factors. These include poverty, historical trauma, bi-cultural  stress, and changing tribal and family roles. There are few evaluated programs  addressing early adolescent AI substance abuse. Tribal communities must be  actively engaged in program development and implementation to ensure cultural  relevance and sustainability of prevention programs. This project proposes to  evaluate an after-school substance abuse prevention intervention, the  Intertribal Talking Circle (ITC), targeting 6th grade AI youth in three AI  communities: Ojibwe/Chippewa in Minnesota, Choctaw in Oklahoma, and Lumbee in  North Carolina. A community-based participatory research approach will be used  to culturally and technologically adapt the ITC. A two-condition controlled  study will evaluate the efficacy of the ITC to increase AI youth Native self-  reliance while decreasing AI youth substance use involvement. An adult training  program second level intervention study is also proposed to train tribal  personnel from the three regional tribes on how to implement the Intertribal  Talking Circle intervention as a tribl program beyond the study period.  Effectiveness will be determined by a small partial cross-over randomized trial  comparing ITC intervention to a Wait-List Control (WLC) condition. Process  evaluations will focus on the future adoption and implementation of the ITC,  and recommendations for sustainable adaptations. The project will also build AI  capacity to address health disparities, as experienced Native investigators  will mentor three Junior Native Investigators.</p>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
               		    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With substance abuse  concerns plaguing tribal communities, health preventive approaches for American  Indian (AI) children need urgent attention. Mainstream programs fall short by  failing to speak to AI children on their own terms. Not so with the Family  Listening/Circle Program (FL/CP) which integrates an evidence-based  family-strengthening core, with cultural values and practices for 4th graders,  their parents and elders? Through previous Native American Research Centers for  Health funding (Indian Health Service &amp; National Institutes of Health  partnership) the FL/CP was created and piloted by community-based participatory  research (CBPR) partnerships between the University of New Mexico Center for  Participatory Research and three tribal communities: Pueblo of Jemez, Ramah  Band of Navajo and Mescalero Apache Nation. FL/CP fills a gap in substance  abuse prevention by recapturing historic traditions of cultural transmission,  such as family dinner story <br>
               		    telling where elders connect with children, supporting  enhanced child-family communication and psycho-social coping through  traditional dialogue, indigenous languages and empowerment where children and  families create community action projects addressing community substance abuse.  With initial FL/CP pilot and feasibility research completed, Tribal Research  Teams (TRTs) from the Pueblo of Jemez, Ramah Band of Navajo and Mescalero  Apache Nation are now in place for full program implementation and  effectiveness testing through a longitudinal quasi-experimental design  involving a long-term, multi-tribal/academic research partnership. Under this  five-year R01 effectiveness trial, tribal partners are committed to assessing  the program's effectiveness and disseminating the approach and intervention  within Indian Country as a best practice in reducing substance abuse health  disparities, with TRTs collaborating on all research activities,  implementation, interpretation/analysis, and dissemination plans. Three  specific aims are 1) To rigorously test effectiveness of FLCP; with a  comparative longitudinal design within and across the tribes, with 4th graders  to prevent substance initiation/use and strengthen families; 2) Through CBPR,  support TRTs to transform their research capacities into local prevention  research infrastructures and partnering; 3) To assess additional program  effects on other health/education programs and leadership within the tribes. In  sum, this multi-tribal/academic partnership builds on accomplishments to test  the effectiveness of an innovative intervention. This grant provides an  unparalleled opportunity to reduce substance abuse in three tribal communities,  strengthen tribal research capacities, and impact substance abuse prevention  research designs nationally, by illustrating how CBPR processes can integrate  evidence-based and cultural-centered practices to create effective programs  that generate community ownership and sustainability.</p>

           		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
       		      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and substance abuse are  increasingly prevalent, costly, and deadly--fueling a twin epidemic in the  United States. The importance of addressing obesity and alcohol and other drug  (AOD) use simultaneously is supported in part by recent research at NIDA  linking the brain mechanisms that fuel drug addiction and compulsive eating  behaviors. Although AOD abstention and abuse patterns vary considerably by  region and tribe, American Indian (AI) drug-related deaths are 1.5 times higher  than for all other ethnic groups in the US. AI women in particular exhibit  significant disparities with other women in obesity and AOD prevalence and  higher rates of premature mortality and morbidity as a result. Based on  preliminary research, we have developed the Yappalli Choctaw Road to Health, a  culturally focused, strengths-based outdoor experiential obesity-AOD risk  prevention and health leadership program. The 3-month intervention (i.e., 3  individual meetings; 8 group-sessions + 2-day culture boot camp + 10-day  Choctaw Trail of Tears walk) is grounded in the PI's Indiginest Stress-Coping  Model and the Information-Motivational- Behavioral Skills framework, with  activities consistent with Motivational Interviewing and leadership development  principles. This RO1 application, prepared in response to PAR-11-346  (Interventions for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Native American  Populations), proposes to evaluate the program among 150 at-risk adult Choctaw  women across 5 regions of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma (CNO), where Native  women have some of the highest obesity, physical inactivity, and excessive  drinking prevalence in the country. We will conduct a longitudinal study using  a cluster randomized stepped-wedge design to evaluate the intervention impact  on the AOD and obesity prevention primary aims of: (1) substance use harm  reduction (SUHR) and AOD use and intentions to use; and (2) reduction in  weight/BMI and increase in leisure-time physical activity and healthful food  habits. The project is multidisciplinary community-based participatory research  collaboration among experienced AI researchers at the Universities of  Washington and Minnesota and Choctaw behavioral health leaders and providers. A  unique feature of the proposed project is its direction at both the university  and tribal levels by Choctaws. The project is supported by pilot and tribal  acceptability data; addresses a critical public health issue among a group  experiencing considerable health disparities; and strengthens the research  infrastructure in partnership with the Tribe. If efficacious, it has the  potential for widespread dissemination and could be generalizable to other  chronic co-occurring mental health and physical health conditions (e.g.,  diabetes and depression).</p></div>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
   		        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks funding for a multi-reservation randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a popular, widely disseminated, substance abuse prevention program targeted at Anishinabe (Ojibwe) preadolescents aged 8-10 years, their parents/caretakers, and extended family adults who have daily influence over the target child's behaviors. The Bii-Zin-Da-De-Dah (BZDDD) (Listening to One Another) program was the first American Indian (AI) adaptation of the Iowa Strengthening Families Program. Now in its third generation, BZDDD has been adapted for Dakota, Lakota, Pueblo, and Navajo cultures and is currently the center piece of a Canadian national Indigenous mental health promotion funded by Public Health Agency of Canada. Although BZDDD has been extremely popular at the grassroots level and has been adapted to numerous cultures there has never been a large-scale empirical evaluation of the program's efficacy for reducing adolescent alcohol and drug use. Our overall goal is to implement a RCT of a fourth-generation BZDDD prevention program that can be replicated cross-culturally by other North American Indigenous cultures to decrease substance use among early adolescents and improve mental health outcomes. This goal will be accomplished through four specific aims: 1) Complete a final adaptation of the 14-week BZDDD prevention program for the U.S. reservations; 2) Implement a RCT of BZDDD to assess its efficacy for delaying and/or preventing adolescent onset of alcohol and drug use; 3) Empirically address cultural challenges for RCTs involving Indigenous cultures by evaluating contamination and informal diffusion in communities and extended families; and 4) Work with our Anishinabe research partners to develop a plan to sustain the prevention. Using intent to treat design, the RCT will involve 255 treatment and 255 waitlist control families who live on or near five Anishinabe reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. There will be a pretest and initial post-test, with subsequent 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 month follow-ups, thus evaluating the target children through the critical years of substance use initiation. The proposed RCT will leave behind an empirically-based, family-centered prevention program that is easily woven into existing tribal social and health services or school settings. It also will be a template for adaptation to other Indigenous cultures.</p></div>

          <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            Back to Basics is a mixed-methods intervention trial to reduce the prevalence of obese Alaska Native children by increasing the proportion of nutrient-dense traditional and non-traditional foods consumed, and decreasing consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). This 5-year intervention trial targeting 0-5 year olds is conducted in partnership with Rural Action Community Action Program, Inc. (RC) Head Start, Early Head Start, and Parents as Teachers programs in 12 rural Alaskan communities, where each site is assigned to either a 9-month nutritional education and meal program intervention or a standard education and meal program repeating annually.</p>
          <p>Once a nomadic population that lived entirely off the land, river, and sea, Alaska Native people have experienced an abrupt nutritional shift towards greater consumption of store-bought manufactured foods and a more sedentary lifestyle. A recent study of dietary adequacy among Alaska Native women in western Alaska found that traditional foods accounted for only 17% of calories, but provided 34% of protein, as well as disproportionately large amounts of essential vitamins and minerals. SSBs were consumed more than any other dietary item and accounted for 8% of calories. </p>
          <p>Over the past three decades, childhood obesity has emerged as a serious public health problem, increasing three-fold across all races and ethnicities. Obesity is highest among Hispanic and Alaska Native/American Indian (AN/AI) children and adults, with 41% of Alaska Native children 2-5 years of age overweight or obese in 2009. Substantial evidence suggests that obesity in early childhood, ages 0-5 years, is a critical factor in the development of adolescent and adult obesity. Obesity, in childhood and adulthood, is a major risk factor for serious immediate and long-term life-threatening health conditions, such as glucose intolerance, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.</p>
          Back to Basics has an unprecedented opportunity to incorporate the lessons learned through past research (Store Outside Your Door) and build on previous study designs and interventions (Hip-Hop to Health, Jr.) in implementing an effective intervention to improve dietary quality through promotion and reincorporation of traditional foods in at-risk young children and their families. A home-based nutrition education curriculum and Head Start center-based meal service focused on traditional foods, will serve as the foundation of the intervention. If effective, this strategy can be adapted and implemented by other Head Start programs across the state to further improve diet quality of all Alaska Native children.</div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                     Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has escalated to epidemic proportion and can cause maternal and child complications. GDM is a significant maternal risk factor for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and places the fetus at increased risk for congenital morbidity/mortality and for future onset of diabetes. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women are twice as likely to develop GDM and T2D; mostly due to healthcare disparities (e.g., limited access to resources, lack of culturally relevant programs). The need for an inexpensive accessible GDM intervention in this population is compelling. The intervention should be delivered during adolescence and prior to sexual debut. Preconception counseling (PC) prevents unplanned pregnancies and significantly reduces risks of complications. If GDM in a previous pregnancy is an indicator of high risk in subsequent pregnancies, then preventing GDM in a first pregnancy is imperative. For a significant and innovative shift in paradigm, we propose a primary prevention PC intervention for AI/adolescent females at risk for GDM to enhance healthy lifestyle behaviors and family planning vigilance prior to this first pregnancy. We will target girls starting at the age of 12 to coincide with boththe  Coming-of-Age  rituals for AI/AN girls during which many receive womanly advice from elder female family members, and the American Diabetes Association recommendation that PC in all females should start at puberty. This new directive will require support from the teens  mothers (or their female caregiver) and well-informed community health care professionals (HCP). Our objective is to adapt our current PC intervention (validated for teens with diabetes) using a sequential mixed-method design with a multi-tribal AI/AN community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach (e.g., Navajo, Cherokee, 40 Oklahoma tribes; 8 project members are AI/AN) by first using focus groups of teens, mothers, HCP, and Tribal leaders; and then testing this culturally appropriate PC theory-based intervention named  STOP-GDM  in AI/AN adolescent females 12 to &lt;20yrs at risk for GDM (e.g., pre-diabetes or BMI&gt; 85%). Teens and their mothers will receive STOP-GDM to raise their awareness of the risks of GDM and benefits of healthy lifestyle to reduce these risks. By also providing mothers with PC knowledge and skills they can naturally weave cultural/social influences into their communications with their daughters. The multi-level intervention will be directed at the individual, familial and institutioal levels simultaneously. AI/AN community-researcher partnerships have been established. A randomized controlled trial with a 15mos follow-up will test the effects of receiving online STOP-GDM on mother-daughter (M-D) cognitive/psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, and daughter family planning vigilance. The final online STOP- GDM program will be provided at no cost to the Indian Health Service (IHS) for dissemination to all their sites. HCPs at each clinical facilit will be given free access to a continuing education program for PC training. This proposal provides a unique opportunity for a broad dissemination to significantly impact all IHS AI/AN female teens at risk for GDM, and help to prevent them and their future children from developing T2D.

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children are considered gifts and  play a central role in American Indian (AI) culture. However, AI children are  at elevated risk for experiencing poverty, parental mental health disorders,  household exposure to substance use, domestic violence, and maltreatment, all  of which increase their risk of poor mental and physical health outcomes as  adolescents and adults. Virtually no evidence-based programs exist that can be  administered in a resource-poor tribal setting, can be culturally adapted, can  be exported, and hold promise for sustainability. The needs of these vulnerable  AI children, thus, remain almost entirely unmet. Decades of research have shown  that secure attachment in infancy and early childhood is a key developmental  building block that predicts adjustment and promotes resilience in children who  grow up under stressful circumstances. Because secure attachment develops from  caregiver sensitivity and responsiveness, it is critical to address caregiver  sensitivity in early childhood. We will, therefore, test the Promoting First  Relationships (PFR) program, a theoretically driven, relationship- and  strengths-based primary prevention program. Several studies have shown the  diverse positive effects of PFR on the caregiver-child relationship for at-risk  populations. The University of Washington Partnerships for Native Health have  nurtured a strong, long term collaboration with the Fort Peck Tribes, whose  reservation lies in a remote area of northeastern Montana. The tribes&rsquo; Elders  Involved Initiative has stated that the health and well-being of children and  young adults are their primary concern, recommending a return to traditional  parenting values. With our tribal partner, we will adapt PFR to ensure cultural  appropriateness, then conduct a randomized, controlled trial to compare the PFR  intervention with a control group receiving information on resources and  referrals. Our primary purpose is to test the effectiveness of PFR in improving  the caregiver's sensitivity to the child (primary outcome). We will also  examine child attachment security to the caregiver and the child's social and emotional  functioning. Our specific aims are to 1) adapt the PFR intervention using focus  groups; 2) assess the adequacy of training by examining the pre- and  post-training attitudes and consultation strategies used by community-based PFR  providers with caregivers and infants; and 3) compare the PFR and control group  on caregivers&rsquo; sensitivity and responsiveness and children's social and  emotional competencies and attachment security. Effective primary preventive  interventions are critically needed for AI children who grow up under stressful  circumstances. By promoting sensitive caregiving and child attachment security,  we can minimize the impact of contextual stressors on children living on the  Fort Peck reservation and, foster resilience, and improve their risk outlook.</p>                                      	</div>

<p> <strong>Abstract<br>
	    </strong>Abstract: Secondhand smoke (SHS) is recognized as a class  A carcinogen and has no safe level of exposure. Nonsmokers from the Cheyenne  River Sioux Tribe, a Lakota tribe from South Dakota, disproportionately share  the burden of SHS, especially in their homes. Our own recently completed  research finds that 19% of Lakota non-smoking adults (including those on  Cheyenne River) have cotinine levels (a metabolite of nicotine) &gt;15 ng/ml,  which are comparable to levels typically seen in active smokers. With smoking prevalence  as high as 50% among this population, the consequences of SHS already manifest  in this tribe, including high prevalence of childhood asthma and sudden infant  death syndrome. Further complicating matters, the expanded use of commercial  tobacco products for ceremonial and cultural practices is creating challenges  not typically seen in non-American Indian communities. Therefore, eliminating  SHS exposure in a culturally appropriate manner is a fundamental step in  decreasing morbidity and mortality among Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and other  Northern Plains Tribes. Our primary study objective is to develop and test a  culturally tailored intervention to encourage adoption of home smoking  restrictions in Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal households where nonsmokers are  present. We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to test our  culturally-tailored advocacy training both with and without urinary biomarker  feedback. Biomarker feedback is an intervention method that can give  personalized information, including levels of urinary or serum cotinine and/or  tobacco-specific pro-carcinogen markers, back to individuals in order to  characterize evidence of the negative sequelae of smoking in the household.  Previous studies, including our pilot project, have focused on providing  children's biomarker feedback back to decision-making smokers, but the evidence  that this approach can promote in-home smoking restrictions is thus far mixed.  This study appears to be the first to use biomarker feedback with adult nonsmokers  for advocacy efforts. Our Specific Aims are to: </p>                                       
       		    <p>1) Assess knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about  secondhand smoke exposure and perceived barriers to adoption of smoking  restrictions in tribal member households on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe  Reservation; 2) Augment, implement, and evaluate a nonsmokers&rsquo; urinary cotinine  and carcinogen biomarker feedback intervention on the adoption of household  smoking restrictions; and 3) Determine the effect of the intervention on  health-related quality of life 6 months after implementation of the advocacy  and biomarker feedback intervention.</p></div>

						<p> <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical need exists for  efficient community-based interventions aimed at reduction of environmental  exposures relevant to health. Biomass smoke exposures due to residential wood  heating are common among rural Native American communities, and such exposures  have been associated with respiratory disease in susceptible populations. In  many of these communities wood stoves are the most economic and traditionally  preferred method of residential heating, but resource scarcity can result in  burning of improper wood fuels and corresponding high levels of indoor  particulate matter. In response to the funding announcement &quot;Interventions  for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Native American  Populations&quot; (PAR-11-346), we propose a two-level intervention strategy to  reduce exposure to indoor biomass smoke among elderly tribal members in two  reservation communities: Nez Perce and Navajo Nation. Community-based  participatory research techniques will be used to adapt intervention approaches  to meet the cultural context of each participating community. At the community  level, we will facilitate local development of a tribal agency-led wood bank  program ensuring that elderly and/or persons with need have access to dry wood  for heating. At the household level, we will use a three arm randomized  placebo-controlled intervention trial to implement and assess  education/outreach on best burn practices (Tx1). The content and delivery  strategies of the education intervention will be adapted to each community  according to stakeholder input. This educational intervention will be evaluated  against an indoor air filtration unit arm (Tx2), as well as a placebo arm (Tx3,  sham air filters). Tx3 will be used in comparison with the other two treatment  arms to evaluate the penetration and efficacy of the community-level wood bank  program. Outcomes will be evaluated with respect to changes in pulmonary  function measures and respiratory symptoms and conditions among household  elders. We hypothesize that locally-designed education-based interventions at  the community and household levels will result in efficacious and sustainable  strategies for reducing personal exposures to indoor particulate matter, and  lead to respiratory health improvements in elderly Native populations. This  study will advance knowledge of cost-effective environmental interventions  within two unique Native American communities, and inform sustainable  multi-level strategies in similar communities throughout the US to improve  respiratory health among at-risk populations.</p></div>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: In the Strong Heart Study (SHS),  chronic low-to-moderate arsenic exposure in drinking water is associated with  an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and  cancer in American Indians (AI) from Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota.  Effective interventions are urgently needed to mitigate arsenic exposure in AI  communities who rely on private wells as the main source of water for drinking  and cooking. Objective: The purpose of the study is to design, implement, and  evaluate multi-level participatory interventions that can lead to a sustained  reduction in arsenic exposure in AI communities in North/South Dakota that  remained exposed to elevated arsenic levels in drinking water. Preliminary  studies: In a recent pilot study, &gt;50% of private wells from Spirit Lake  (North Dakota) and Pine Ridge (South Dakota) had arsenic levels in drinking  water exceeding the US Environmental Protection Agency standard (10 ¿g/L).  Design and setting: This study will be divided into 3 phases: (1) Formative  research and planning; (2) Implementation and evaluation of the multi-level  intervention; and (3) Dissemination at the household, tribal, regional, and  national levels. The formative research and planning phase will develop and  pilot arsenic interventions through in- depth interviews and focus group  discussions, a community advisory board workshop, and a pilot study. We will  build local capacity to ensure the long-term sustainability of the intervention  program by developing a training program for community members to test water  sources for arsenic using rapid field kits, installing and maintaining point of  use arsenic removal devices, and disseminating the developed health messages.  During the intervention phase we will conduct a two-arm cluster-randomized  controlled trial to prospectively follow 300 households and 600 participants (2  per household) to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed multi- level  intervention in reducing urine arsenic concentrations and biomarkers of  cardiovascular disease (cell adhesion molecules) and diabetes (glycated  hemoglobin) during a 6 month period. The first arm will receive water arsenic  testing and an arsenic removal device during one home visit by a community promoter  (standard program). The second arm will receive water arsenic testing, an  arsenic removal device, and an intensive health promotion program of 5 home  visits by a community promoter (intensive health promotion program). To assess  the long-term sustainability, we will measure arsenic in urine and water, and  collect meter-based water use and self-reported device maintenance data 1 to 3  years after baseline. During the dissemination phase, we will work closely with  tribal leaders and the Indian Health Service to disseminate study findings and  develop sustainable arsenic mitigation policies to upscale the developed  intervention programs to include other AI communities. Significance: This study  will be the first to develop, implement, and evaluate a participatory  multi-level intervention to reduce arsenic exposure from private wells in AI  communities and to determine if the intervention can reduce arsenic exposure  and early biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
  DESCRIPTION  (provided by applicant): Background: Food insecurity increases the risk of  obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. American Indians (AIs) in Oklahoma  are three times as likely as Whites to be food-insecure (21% vs. 7%) and have  burdens of obesity (42%), hypertension (38%), and diabetes (15%) that exceed  those of the general US population. While individual-level obesity prevention  efforts have been implemented with AIs, few environmental interventions to  reduce food insecurity and improve fruit and vegetable intake have been  conducted with tribal communities. Community gardening interventions have been  shown to increase vegetable and fruit intake, reduce food insecurity, and lower  BMI among children and adults; however, to date, no such interventions have  been evaluated with AI families. The proposed study, entitled &quot;Food Equity  Resource and Sustainability for Health (FRESH),&quot; will assess the impact of  a tribally-initiated community gardening intervention on vegetable and fruit  intake, food insecurity, BMI, and blood pressure in families living on the  Osage Nation reservation in Oklahoma. The intervention will take place in the  inaugural year of Osage Nation's Bird Creek Farm and Community Gardens, where  120 garden plots will be allocated to participating reservation families. The  study is guided by the principles of community-based participatory research  (CBPR) and the Indigenous food sovereignty movement, which seeks to revitalize  seasonal growing and gathering practices and reverse the tide of unhealthy  eating caused by the historical loss of tribal lands. Aims and Methods: Led by  an AI (Choctaw) Investigator, the study will: Aim #1: Characterize the Osage  Nation reservation's food environment by using both objective and perceived  measures, and then examine the relationships between these measures and intake  of vegetables and fruits, food insecurity, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes. Aim  #2: Develop a culturally relevant community gardening intervention and conduct  a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate its efficacy in increasing  vegetable and fruit intake and reducing food insecurity, BMI, and blood  pressure among Osage families. Aim #3: Create and disseminate a Web- based  multimedia manual and documentary film, and evaluate their effectiveness in  increasing tribal readiness and capacity to improve local food environments.  Innovation: The proposed study will be the first RCT ever conducted of a  community gardening intervention, as well as the first community gardening  intervention with AI families. The study will also be one of the first  environmental interventions o simultaneously address healthy food production,  access, preference, and intake among AIs. Significance and Impact: The  community gardening intervention will be developed as part of a larger Osage  Nation initiative on food security and food sovereignty and as such, is likely  to be sustainable if it proves effective. Research findings and products will  be disseminated to AI/AN communities nationwide and will help to identify  environmental strategies that will improve tribal food environments and the  health and quality of life of AI families.</p>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                        Untreated PTSD elevates risk of concurrent alcohol and drug dependence (&gt;50% and &gt;30% respectively), which in turn elevates risk of HIV sexual-risk behavior (HSB). A meta-analysis of HIV prevention, found few interventions address risk factors such as trauma exposure, mental health, or SUD and interventions which failed to do so had poorer condom use outcomes and were less effective for those with PTSD. From a public health perspective addressing PTSD and substance use disorders (SUD) is an important but overlooked means of preventing HIV/STI. American Indian (AI) communities are at disproportionate risk for untreated PTSD, SUD and HIV/STI risk. Self-medication of PTSD through substance use leads to development of SUDs, and exacerbates HSB. Therefore, treatment of PTSD that also decreases substance use in individuals may prevent the initiation or relapse of HIV risk behaviors. Similarly, directly intervening to reduce substance use via increasing motivation to decrease use and enhance coping strategies should prevent SUD development, and improve HSB and PTSD. Thus addressing PTSD or substance use may effectively prevent HSB. Built on an 8-year community-based participatory partnership, in full collaboration with the Tribal Nation, this study proposes a 5-year two-arm randomized comparative effectiveness trial to evaluate prevention of HIV/STI sexual risk behavior by directly addressing PTSD or substance use. We will evaluate Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) versus Motivational Interviewing with Skills Training (MIST) in HIV/STI prevention. AI elder and community leaders have insisted that &ldquo;we can keep providing substance use or sexual risk programs but until we get to the underlying cause – trauma – then we&rsquo;ll keep replacing one means of avoidance for another&rdquo;. This study will help address this community-generated clinical and empirical question. The overall goal is to compare two evidence based treatments, each addressing a different HSB causal pathway. NET addresses PTSD preventing SUD and HSB. MIST addresses substance misuse preventing SUD and HSB. <br>
                        <strong>Aim 1</strong>: To examine a PTSD versus a substance use-focused intervention to prevent HSB. We will conduct a two-arm randomized comparative effectiveness trial comparing NET (n=100) to MIST (n=100) among AI men and women with PTSD symptoms. We will evaluate the effect of reductions in PTSD severity and substance use (e.g., frequency, quantity, intentions, relapse, and initiation of use) on HSB (e.g., number of partners, sex while using substances, unprotected sex, and sex with high-risk partners) at post, 6, and 12-month follow-up.<br>
<strong>Aim 2</strong>: To examine theoretical mediators of treatment on HSB outcomes including emotional regulation,
cognitive reappraisals, coping self-efficacy, communication skills, assertiveness, and community
connectiveness.</p>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                        American Indian (AI) communities in the United States (US) are disproportionately affected by sexual and reproductive health disparities, compared to other populations, placing current and future generations of AI societies in jeopardy. Our study, “Nen ŨnkUmbi/EdaHiYedo (N/E - “We are Here Now”)”, utilizes a culturally tailored ecological intervention in which the prevention of sexual-risk behaviors among AI youth that lead to STIs, HIV, HCV, and teen pregnancy are addressed. N/E takes place on the Fort Peck Reservation in northeastern Montana. N/E is a community-based participatory research sexual and reproductive health (SRH) intervention, constructed on Ecological Systems Theory. Based on Fort Peck tribal members' desire to implement a holistic SRH intervention for the tribes' youth, N/E includes: 1) A school-based SRH curriculum called Native Stand, designed to address individual-level factors that lead to risky behaviors; 2) a family-level curriculum called Native Voices, tailored to increase communication between adult family members and youth about SRH topics; 3) a cultural mentoring component at the community-level that pairs AI youth with adults and elders to discuss traditional AI beliefs and practices about SRH; and 4) a systems-level strategy to activate a multi-sectoral network of local youth servicing organizations to coordinate SRH services. The overarching aim of this proposal is to refine and tailor the components of N/E and evaluate its efficacy. N/E is a 5-year study involving 456 15- to 18-year-old AI youth and their parent/legal guardian. AIM 1 begins with a year of formative work to refine and tailor the components of N/E. Our community advisory board and the Fort Peck-based and MSU-based research team will design culturally appropriate adaptations for N/E's 4 levels. AIM 2 tests the efficacy of N/E using a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design (SWD), in which the 5 high schools that Fort Peck youth attend are randomized into the intervention 1 at a time. N/E's primary outcome is increased condom use during sexual intercourse. Secondary outcomes are delayed onset of sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, frequency of sexual intercourse, pregnancy history, consistent use of birth control during sexual intercourse, and whether alcohol and/or other drugs are used during sexual intercourse. Tertiary outcomes are increased parent/legal guardian-child communication about SRH topics, increased understanding of cultural values related to traditional AI beliefs regarding SRH, and increased use of SRH services. Quantitative data collection includes: student surveys at baseline, 3, 9 and 12 months; parent/legal guardian surveys at baseline, 9 and 12 months. Qualitative data collection includes SRH service provider discussion groups at baseline and thereafter once a year over the 5-year study, with logs to track coordination and implementation at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. AIM 3 will evaluate the fidelity and acceptability of N/E with focus groups, activity logs, and staff meeting notes and staff field notes.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
          High rates of suicide are endemic in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) young adults. A recent study found that rates for young AI/AN adults in the Northern Plains and in Alaska are more than 4 times higher than for Whites of the same age in the same regions. Building social connections is a key goal of suicide prevention. One validated theoretical model asserts that belonging to a group is a fundamental human need. When this need is thwarted by social isolation or inadequate social support, a desire for death emerges. Studies of suicide prevention in AI/ANs underscore the cultural importance of connection to friends, family, caring neighbors, and community leaders. These traditions of community cohesion can be leveraged to protect young AI/AN adults against suicidal ideation and behavior. Caring Contacts is a suicide prevention program that supplements standard care by promoting human connectedness. People at risk for suicide often lose contact with the healthcare system and receive no follow-up care. For 1 year after an initial presentation, Caring Contacts seeks out such individuals to send messages expressing care, concern, and interest. It is the only intervention shown to prevent suicide in any population in a randomized, controlled trial. Based on an almost two year collaborative process with four tribal partners as part of a pilot grant, we have designed a locally feasible, culturally appropriate Caring Contacts intervention that will use text messaging, the dominant communication method for young AI/AN adults. This study uses a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate this approach to suicide prevention in 1,200 high-risk AI/ANs aged 18-34 from our four partner communities. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Compare the effectiveness of usual care (control) to the control condition plus caring text messages (intervention) for reducing suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide- related hospitalizations. 2) Evaluate social connectedness as a mediating factor for the effect of Caring Contacts via text message on suicidality. The US Surgeon General's National Strategy for Suicide Prevention identifies connectedness to others as the primary protective factor against suicidality.53 By adapting and disseminating the Caring Contacts approach, which has demonstrated effectiveness in non-Native populations, our study will evaluate a low-cost, sustainable intervention for addressing the profound disparity of suicide risk experienced by young adult AI/ANs.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
          With rates up to 18 times higher for rural Alaska Native (AN) young people when compared to all American youth (124 vs 6.9 per 100,000), the health disparity of youth suicide continues to plague rural Indigenous communities in Alaska. The current system of care—with a focus on mental health—is not effective: 79% of suicide decedents and 62% of attempters received NO mental health care. Vulnerable AN youth are more likely to come into contact with healthcare providers, school personnel, public safety workers, and other community members. Additionally, friends and family members noticed signs of risk beforehand in 62% of all recorded suicidal behavior. These villagers can offer culturally-specific social support and safety measures to avert a suicide crisis, but they are not trained to initiate primary and secondary prevention. Currently, three times out of four, community members mobilize only when the person is in `imminent risk' of suicide. This level of risk means that vulnerable AN youth are taken 500 air miles away for assessment in a confined hospital room many associate with `jail'. After this experience, most AN youth return home less likely to seek help the next time they feel suicidal. Late intervention cuts off options for cultural, family and community-based care, which is preferred by AN youth and their families. To initiate activities to promote wellness, safety and support before a suicide crisis, our tribal working group developed and piloted PC CARES: Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide. This promising and feasible educational intervention is led by local facilitators, and offers village stakeholders a series of learning circles to study `what we know' from prevention research and figure out how they can apply it to their jobs, families, and lives. The goal of the intervention is to enhance knowledge, skills and attitudes among service providers, family members and tribal residents so that they promote wellbeing, recognize risk, support vulnerable youth, and work with others in their community to take supportive and safety actions when they notice signs of vulnerability. Our community intervention utilizes indigenous pedagogy and prevention science to increase village members' and service providers' capacity to find `up-stream', self-determined and culturally-responsive ways to reduce suicide risk. Using a community-based, participatory research (CBPR) approach, our specific aims track change on both individual and community levels. Aim 1: Track the effect of PC CARES on participants' knowledge, attitudes and behavior, and identify key factors influencing these outcomes over time. Aim 2: Document the community-level impact of PC CARES by tracking the number and type of interactions aimed at preventing youth suicide and promoting wellness in participating villages, and describe changes in the supportive social networks of young people before and after the intervention. IMPACT: Our scalable model offers under-resourced Native communities a practical method for translating scientific research into culturally relevant efforts to reduce suicide risk factors, and increase safety, help-seeking and support to prevent suicide.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
          The overall goal of this study is to develop, adapt and evaluate an intergenerational prevention intervention, named “Wa’ Kan ye’ zah (Little Holy One),” with Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux caregivers and their 3-to-5- year-old children. The intervention aims to: 1) reduce symptoms of historical trauma and everyday stress among parents/caregivers, 2) improve parenting, and 3) improve children’s emotional and behavioral developmental outcomes to reduce future risk for suicide and substance use. The scientific premise of this work is rooted in understanding that high rates of historical and current trauma in Native communities compromise caregivers’ mental health and parenting, which in turn affect early childhood behavior problems and adverse events that increase children’s risk for suicide and substance use in adolescent and young adulthood. Without intervention, this intergenerational cycle may repeat. Wa’ Kan ye’ zah will combine adapted elements of: 1) Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, an evidence-based intervention proven effective to reduce stress, depression and trauma-related symptoms, 2) Family Spirit, an evidence-based parent training program to promote positive early child development in Native American communities, and 3) cultural components informed by tribal-specific risk and protective factors for suicide and substance abuse identified in community-based studies that led to this proposal. The intervention will consist of 12 weekly individual lessons taught to parents and children (ages 3 to 5) at the Poplar and Wolf Point Head Start facilities by indigenous community health workers, a delivery strategy selected to enhance participant engagement, local acceptability and sustainability. Intervention timing is focused at a critical developmental phase—when primary attachment is still to parents, but while children are transitioning to greater self-regulation and cooperation with teachers and peers in Head Start classrooms. This study will use a randomized control trial (RCT) with an embedded single-case experimental design (SCED) to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on mental health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while empirically exploring the added benefit of specific cultural components on parent/caregiver outcomes. on mental health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while exploring the added benefit of cultural components on parent outcomes. The study plan is situated within a well-established trust relationship with tribal communities, innovative formative research that led to this proposal, and an experienced, multi- disciplined study team led by an indigenous PI. </p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
          Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most common chronic disease among children. American Indian (AI) children are 4 times more likely to have untreated dental decay than white children. If left untreated, ECC can lead to chronic pain, loss of teeth, poor nutrition, and impaired growth. The proposed study aims to reduce the burden of ECC in two AI communities through an innovative, community based participatory approach. The project will: 1) partner with 2 tribes, the Hopi Tribe (Arizona) and the Crow Tribe (Montana), to conduct a formative assessment on oral health (OH); 2) adapt a “bundled” best practices OH intervention to be locally and contextually relevant for each of our tribal communities; and 3) conduct a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the impact of the “bundled” best practices OH intervention (compared to a standard prenatal/postnatal healthy lifestyle intervention) on the reduction of ECC. Community health representatives (CHRs) will be trained to deliver the interventions with pregnant women and follow them until the child’s last exam (24-36 months). The OH intervention will consist of 4 intervention components known to be effective (best practices) in the prevention of ECC: 1) dietary and OH education provided during pregnancy and the postnatal period; 2) OH care of children including the application of fluoride varnish; 3) motivational interviewing with children’s mothers; and 4) patient navigation of existing OH and other social services in each study community, facilitated by CHRs. Caries experience (dmfs) and severity will be compared across both conditions at the 1, 2, and 3- year exams. Mother knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to ECC will be also measured for both conditions at pre-test and post-test. Surveys will assess each level of the social ecological model. Individual level domains will include: 1) demographics of mother and baby (pre-test only); 2) dental health of the child to date; 3) mother’s and child’s OH (postnatal); 4) mother’s knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about best practices in OH; 5) mother’s perception of self-efficacy and susceptibility; and 6) mother’s prenatal health and experiences. Interpersonal level domains will include: 1) current living situation and family support; 2) availability of emotional, informational, and instrumental support; and 3) perceptions of peers’ and family members’ attitudes toward caregiving and OH. Community level domains will include: 1) tribal identity and related experiences; 2) care coordination, transportation, and access to social and OH services; and 3) perceptions of cultural congruence of CHR interactions and intervention materials. If successful, this community-based approach may prove to be a feasible method for improving OH of AI children and reducing the burden of ECC in many Native communities with limited access to regular dental care. </p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
          Project Abstract Yup’ik children in Alaska’s YK Delta consume an average of 50 teaspoons of sugar each day, 16 times the American Heart Association’s recommended maximum. Most of this sugar is from fruit drinks like Tang and Kool-Aid consumed at home. Consequently, Yup’ik children experience tooth decay rates that are 16x the U.S. average and suffer from oral health inequalities compared to children from communities that are better off. Tooth decay is a multifactorial disease, but our pilot work shows sugared fruit drinks are the key risk factor. YK Delta communities have expressed a desire to target sugared fruit drinks that continue to harm their children. This study is a culmination of over 5 years of engaged research within YK Delta communities to co-develop a culturally-appropriate, feasible, and sustainable program to address persisting public health problems caused by sugared fruit drinks. We propose a 2-arm quasi-experimental behavioral trial in 3 small, isolated Alaska Native communities to test the hypothesis that Community Health Worker-led health education and self- efficacy training for caregivers will decrease child added sugar intake. We will introduce families to sugar-free water enhancers that will be made available through local stores. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Complete pre- intervention activities and finalize the intervention; (2) Implement the intervention and assess outcomes; and (3) Identify intervention improvement opportunities and disseminate findings. This application builds on previous R56 research by the study team and will for the first time seek to change sugared fruit drink intake in Alaska Native communities. 3 communities will be assigned to 1 of 2 arms based on the order communities were recruited into the study. In Communities A and B, 136 Yup’ik children ages 0-10 years will be recruited to test the 6-month culturally-adapted, 5-session intervention consisting of interactive health education and self- efficacy training delivered in-person by an indigenous Community Health Worker. In Community C, 56 children will be recruited to a comparison condition in which health education with the same culturally-adapted content is delivered by mail. Health education will address misinformation about sugared fruit drinks and promote sugar-free water enhancers. Self-efficacy training will empower caregivers to sustain behavior change over time. Local stores in all 3 communities will stock sugar-free water enhancers (Tang, Kool-Aid, and other popular flavors) as a tool to help shift children from sugared fruit drinks. The primary outcomes at the child level are sugared fruit drink intake (24-hour food recalls) and added sugar intake (validated, non-invasive biomarker) and will be measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation will maintain and disseminate the program if it works to address a critical problem facing 15,000+ Alaska Native children in the YK Delta. Moreover, it can be adapted to meet the needs of other populations with similar problems, including the millions of indigenous children in the Lower 48. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Project Narrative Alaska Native and American Indian children suffer from high rates of tooth decay that lead to poor health, low quality of life, and broader problems like learning difficulties in school that have life-long consequences. In response to the FOA calling for health promotion interventions focusing on Native American populations, the proposed study will target sugared fruit drinks that cause dental problems in children through a community- based program that builds on proven approaches that have not yet been implemented in Alaska Native communities. The proposed work addresses Healthy People 2020’s Nutrition and Weight Status Objective 17 (reduce added sugars), Oral Health Objective 1 (reduce the proportion of children with tooth decay), and Early and Middle Childhood Objective 1 (increase the proportion of children who are ready for school by ensuring healthy physical development); and NIDCR Strategic Goal 3 (apply rigorous multidisciplinary research to overcome dental disparities).</p>
