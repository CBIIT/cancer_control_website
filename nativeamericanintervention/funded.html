                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developing effective tobacco cessation  interventions during pregnancy for American Indian and Alaska Native people is  a national priority and will contribute to the U.S. public health objective of  reducing tobacco- related health disparities. In the southwest region of Alaska  where the proposed project will take place, 79% of Alaska Native women smoke  cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco (ST) during pregnancy. In addition,  pregnancy appears to be a high risk period for initiation of tobacco use,  primarily ST, among women reporting no use of tobacco 3 months before  pregnancy. Our pilot study suggested that an individual-based intervention  delivered at the first prenatal visit had low reach to pregnant women and poor  tobacco abstinence rates. Intervention efforts targeting the entire community,  not only pregnant women, to address social norms about tobacco use may be more  effective. Thus, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of a novel,  multi-component, theory-based intervention for reducing tobacco use during  pregnancy, incorporating both individually targeted and community level  components delivered by female elders &quot;Native Sisters.&quot; The  intervention builds on effective community and individual-based approaches for  tobacco cessation and lay health advisor approaches for cancer prevention among  Native American women. As part of the intervention, a social marketing campaign  including digital stories and other small media will be developed with  community feedback. Individually targeted components will be six 30-40 minute  telephone or home-based peer counseling sessions with pregnant women. This R01 project is submitted in response to  PAR-11-346. It will be conducted in two phases. All aspects of the project will  be guided by a community advisory committee. In Phase I, we will develop the  social marketing components by obtaining qualitative feedback from pregnant  women, family members and elders on message content and delivery channels. In  Phase II, we will evaluate the intervention using a group- randomized design  with village as the unit of assignment. Sixteen villages will be randomly  assigned to receive the intervention or control condition (usual care), with  &gt; 20 women enrolled from each village. Enrollment will occur at the time of  a positive pregnancy test which is the earliest point of prenatal care,  enhancing the intervention's potential reach. Both tobacco users and non-users  will be eligible because many start to use during pregnancy. Assessments will  be completed by enrolled women through 6 months postpartum. We will evaluate  the efficacy of the intervention compared with the control condition on the  biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence tobacco use rate at week 36  gestation and at 6 months postpartum. We will also examine the effect of the  intervention on proposed social cognitive-theory based mediators of change  including perceived self-efficacy for non-tobacco use and anti-tobacco norms.  Our long term objective is to determine effective interventions for Alaska  Native women that will ultimately reduce the risk of tobacco-related maternal,  fetal, and infant adverse health outcomes.</p>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by  applicant): American Indian tribal  college students have the highest smoking rates of any racial/ethnic group in  the young adult population and also are disproportionately burdened by smoking-related  morbidity and mortality. There are very few effective culturally-tailored  smoking cessation programs for AI smokers. Our research group has worked with  the American Indian community for the past 8 years to develop a  culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (All Nations Breath of Life -  ANBL), for AI adult smokers. All Nations Breath of Life was developed using the  community-based participatory research approach and is an in-person group based  program that incorporates cultural issues throughout the program. We have  produced 30% cessation rates at 6-month follow-up with adult American Indian  smokers from tribes and nations in the Midwest. Due to limited studies with the  tribal college population, we have already conducted a cross-sectional  internet-based survey to collect information on their smoking behaviors as well  as other health behaviors. This research experience and strong collaboration  with the AI community leaves us well poised to adapt the ANBL program for the  tribal college smoking population. However, this current program needs  substantial modifications to meet the unique needs of the tribal college  student population. It recognizes the sacred role of tobacco among many  American Indians and how culture affects smoking cessation among AIs, while  still addressing recreational smoking. However, preliminary data from our  recent studies indicate that the internet may be more favorable and appropriate  delivery method for reaching this younger and more mobile tribal college  population due to the web interactivity, immediacy of feedback, and wide reach  and accessibility. This current proposal reflects a natural progression to  addressing the significant problem of smoking among tribal college students  using our successful methods. In this study, we will adapt and test a  culturally tailored internet-based smoking cessation (I-ANBL) program based on  ANBL, which was developed through CBPR methods. For the current proposal, we  will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (N=242) to test the  effectiveness of an internet-based, culturally tailored smoking cessation  program (I-ANBL) in a tribal college student population. Data will be collected  at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using salivary cotinine, as well as  comprehensive set of environmental and psychosocial measures. We hypothesize  that AI tribal college students randomized to the culturally-tailored smoking  cessation internet arm (I-ANBL) will have significantly higher continuous  abstinence rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet  intervention (I-FV), focusing on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. We  will also examine the costs of delivering the tailored intervention program and  potential mediators and moderators of the intervention-cessation relationship.  Such a high-reach, low-cost strategy for promoting smoking cessation in this  at-risk and underserved population could have great potential for adoption on a  larger scale and thus help reduce existing health disparities. </p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Food  insecurity increases one's risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer  (via its links to poor diet and nutrition), conditions highly prevalent among  Native Americans in Oklahoma (obesity 42%, diabetes 15%, and hypertension  38%).1 Our pilot study shows that 3 times as many Natives in Oklahoma are food  insecure as Whites (21.3% vs. 7.3% respectively).2 Yet few or no studies have  assessed individual- and environmental-level correlates of food insecurity  among Natives and none have developed interventions or broad-based educational  materials within Oklahoma tribal nations.3,4 Aims and Methods: This study, led  by a Native American Choctaw Investigator will, Aim #1: Assess correlates  (sociodemographics, health behaviors, perceived food environment) and outcomes  (dietary intake including vegetables and fruits, BMI, diabetes, and  hypertension) of food insecurity in the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations in  Oklahoma. A telephone survey will be administered to 500 Native American adults  (18+) randomly sampled from tribal registries. Clinical measures will be  validated for 200 of those surveyed using tribal clinic electronic healt  records. Perceptions of food environments will be compared to objective store  measures using GIS data. Aim #2: Design, implement, and evaluate a convenience  store intervention to increase the availability and intake of vegetables and  fruits among tribal members. Using a cluster-randomized design with 20 matched  tribally owned convenience stores (5 cases and 5 controls in each tribe), we  will implement evidence-based strategies (increased availability and variety,  point of purchase information, reduced prices/coupons) to increase the sales  and intake of vegetables and fruits among tribal members. Store-level changes  will be measured by pre/post sales records and the Nutrition Environment  Measures Survey; individual-level changes by two cross-sectional surveys,  administered to 300 convenience store shoppers before and 300 shoppers after  the intervention. Tribal members will use video voice,3 an action-oriented  participatory media research method to collect qualitative and environmental  data (e.g. types of foods/beverages sold and promoted in the convenience  stores) to facilitate community planning and channel recommendations to policy  makers. Aim #3: Create a multimedia manual, co-developed with tribal members,  guiding tribes in food environment changes, and disseminated over a free and  open source Website allowing for tribal user- created content. Innovation: Each  of the 3 aims builds on our preliminary data and/or best practices, and  leverages tribal resources and partnerships to enhance survey participation  rates and convenience store &quot;healthy makeovers.&quot; Significance and  Impact: The knowledge from surveys on food insecurity correlates and health  outcomes will inform the design of the convenience store intervention to increase  availability of vegetables and fruits. The resulting multimedia manual will  guide food environment changes among tribes nationally to address the  critically high rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension within this  population.</p>

Directly informed by the  research team's fieldwork over the past 6 years in rural Alaska, continued  community partnership with the tribes, and ethnographic research, the  interventions will be tailored to AN health needs and values to target 5 of the  American Heart Association's 7 Strategic Impact Goals for 2020. In a randomized controlled 2-group design,  the trial will compare two active treatment conditions: Group 1 targets tobacco  and physical activity; Group 2 targets control of hypertension and  hypercholesterolemia (HTN-HCL) through medication adherence and nutritional  changes. Both conditions utilize trans theoretical model-tailored, computerized  interventions, delivered via telemedicine by Indigenous-focused counselors  located in Anchorage reaching AN people in their rural home villages.  Computerized intervention contacts occur at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months with  final assessment at 18-months. Study design provides an equivalent contact time  and technology comparison; facilitates individual-level randomization within  communities, as all participants receive highly individualized counseling and  intervention materials; and allows for comparison of traditional risk factor  (HTN-HCL) versus risk behavior (tobacco/ physical activity) interventions.  Participants (N=300) will be daily smokers with at least one additional  cardiovascular disease risk factor (e.g., inactivity, overweight, HTN, HCL) or  established vascular disease. The trial aims to reach AN people regardless of  residential location or intention to change.  The primary hypothesis is that Group 1 will achieve significantly  greater biochemically- confirmed tobacco abstinence than Group 2 through  18-months follow-up and secondarily will significantly increase their physical  activity. Secondary hypotheses are that Group 2 will achieve significantly  greater control of HTN and HCL than Group 1 through (i) medication compliance  and (ii) dietary change. Tertiary aims will: (a) compare the interventions on  overall behavior change; (b) model cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of  each intervention; and (c) examine moderators/mediators of treatment outcome,  including the trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio, a noninvasive measure  of nicotine metabolism rate. The proposal combines technology, pharmacology,  behavioral science, and health economics for advancing the health of AN people  who face significant health disparities with limited access to interventions  given their isolated geographics.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) are  experiencing an epidemic of stroke morbidity and mortality, with higher  prevalence and incidence, younger age at onset, and poorer survival than other  racial and ethnic groups. With a stroke incidence more than twice that of the  general U.S. population, stroke in AIs is a public health problem of staggering  scope. AIs also have disproportionate burdens of many risk factors for stroke,  including hypertension, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. However, no rigorous,  population-based studies of stroke prevention have included AIs. Tribes  urgently need evidence-based methods for preventing stroke that minimize clinic  visits and lab tests and use affordably measured endpoints. One such endpoint  is a stroke risk score. We developed a 10-year stroke risk score for AIs using  data from the Strong Heart Study, a large, population-based cohort of 4,549 AIs  from 12 tribes in Arizona, Oklahoma, and the Dakotas. We propose to address the  need for effective, affordable, and sustainable stroke prevention methods in  participants in the Strong Heart Family Study. This study collected  family-cluster data on cardiovascular disease risk factors from 3,800 AIs based  on 94 randomly selected index participants from the Strong Heart Study. With  our partners, we have designed the &quot;Family Intervention in the Spirit of  Motivational Interviewing&quot; (FITSMI), a program delivered at the household  level to encourage lifestyle changes that transform the home environment and  reduce stroke risk for all residents. FITSMI uses a &quot;talking circle&quot;  format in which facilitators guide participants to identify goals for change  and create a tailored plan for sustainable implementation that may target  smoking, exercise, diet, or medication adherence. FITSMI requires just 2  sessions (baseline and 1 month post-baseline), with text messaging used to  boost long-term adherence. In a group-randomized trial design, we will recruit  360 households where Strong Heart Family Study members aged 45 and older  reside. We will assign half to FITSMI and half to a control condition that  receives educational brochures. All household residents e 11 years old will be  eligible. Primary outcomes are household-level improvement in stroke risk score  for adult's e 45 years old, and selected modifiable risk factors for all  participants. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the effectivenes of FITSMI in  AIs e 45 years old to lower stroke risk scores from baseline to 1-year  follow-up, with coronary heart disease risk scores evaluated as a secondary  outcome; and 2) Determine the effectiveness of FITSMI to improve individual  modifiable stroke risk factors (e.g., smoking, blood pressure) in all household  members e 11 years old from baseline to 1-year follow-up. This effort is  aligned with an Institute of Medicine report recommending a shift from  provider- and clinic-centered healthcare to &quot;care based on continuous  healing relationships.&quot; FITSMI is designed to facilitate adoption of  healthy lifestyles to prevent stroke and improve cardiovascular health. If  proven effective, FITSMI has broad, multigenerational public health  implications for prevention of stroke and cardiovascular disease in AI and  non-AI populations. </p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                          Native Hawaiians (NH) have higher rates of chronic diseases, such  as cardiovascular disease<br>
(CVD), diabetes, and cancer. Hypertension (HTN), an important  modifiable risk factor for CVD,<br>
is  70% higher in Native Hawaiians (NH) than in Whites. In fact, NH are 3-4 times  more likely to develop CVD conditions, such as stroke and coronary heart  disease, and at a younger age. In addition to prescribed medication,  improvements in HTN can be achieved through increased physical activity (PA)  and self-management education (e.g. stress management, reduces sodium intake,  weight-loss, and smoking cessation). Yet, many commonly prescribed PA, such as  jogging and use of treadmills, are difficult for NH to initiate and maintain  because of socioeconomic barriers and lack of alignment with NH preferred modes  of living and cultural values (i.e. familial interdependence, group-based PA,  cultural PA). This proposed research uses hula, the traditional dance form of  NH and hallmark of NH culture, as the PA basis for a culturally relevant and  sustainable CVD prevention program targeting HTN management. Hula training is  popular, not only Hawai'i, but across the U.S. through the 784 hālau hula (hula  schools) found in most States. Using a community-based participatory research  (CBPR) framework, a hula-based CVD health intervention was strongly endorsed by  Kumu hula (hula experts and guardians of hula traditions), NH individuals, and  communities. Further, hula training was determined to yield metabolic  equivalent of energy expenditure as a moderate and vigorous intensity PA. Data  from our pilot CBPR randomized control trial (RCT) study found that 60 minutes  of hula training twice a week for 12 weeks reduced systolic blood pressure (BP)  by 7.5 mmHg (SD=16.5) more than the control group, but the long-term effects  were mixed and the study did not assess CVD risk. Interestingly, the pilot  intervention also improved social functioning, reduced physical pain, and  perceived racial discrimination, suggesting a possible psychosocial and  socio-cultural mechanism by which the intervention affects BP. In this  application we offer a CBPR guided RCT of 250 NH with physician-diagnosed HTN  in Hawai'i and Washington State. We will compare the effects of a 6-month  intervention that combines hula training and brief culturally-tailored HTN  self-management education delivered by peer educators and Kumu hula to a  wait-list control group in reducing systolic BP and CVD risk scores. We will  also determine the mediating effects of health behaviors (e.g., smoking), self-regulation,  psychosocial (e.g., social support), and socio-cultural factors (e.g.,  perceived racism) on blood pressure reduction. Our goal is to build on the  existing widespread infrastructure of hālau hula and NH organizations to  deliver a sustainable, culturally-preferred CVD prevention program.</p></div>

                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American  Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth report higher rates of alcohol and drug  (AOD) use, greater frequency and intensity of AOD use, earlier first AOD use,  and much higher alcohol-related mortality than other racial/ethnic groups in  the U.S. Data regarding urban AIs/ANs are limited; however, one study found  that at-risk AIs/AN adults in an urban setting report an earlier onset of  alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, and other drug use compared to all other  ethnic/racial groups within LA County. This proposal responds to PAR-11-346,  Interventions for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Native American  Populations, which is focused on developing, adapting, and testing the  effectiveness of health promotion prevention interventions in Native American  populations. The two Co-PIs provide a unique blend of expertise that has  resulted in the development of an innovative preliminary protocol for AI/AN  youth: Motivational Interviewing and Culture for Urban Native American Youth  (MICUNAY), which integrates traditional healing approaches with motivational  interviewing (MI). Dickerson is an Alaska Native (Inupiaq) new investigator who  worked with the AI/AN community to obtain community-based perspectives on  decreasing AOD use and mental health problems. D'Amico is internationally  recognized for her work focused on the development and testing of MI  interventions targeting AOD use for culturally diverse adolescents across  different settings. Dickerson and colleagues have demonstrated the need for  culturally-appropriate interventions for AI/AN youth. His two community-based  projects found that there is a lack of programs integrating tradition-based  healing with evidenced based treatments (EBTs), and this was cited as a significant  barrier to seeking care within urban AI/AN populations. Therefore, MICUNAY will  integrate tradition-based healing with MI. It consists of 6 weekly 1-hour  sessions (3 MI AOD sessions and 3 tradition activity sessions). Our proposal  also incorporates a multi-system intervention approach. At the individual  level, we will provide MICUNAY to urban AI/AN youth. At the community level, we  will discuss AOD use and AOD prevention among AI/AN youth at existing Community  Wellness Gatherings (CWG). The proposed 5-year study will consist of two main  components: 1) A Developmental Phase in which we conduct focus groups across  two clinical sites in Los Angeles and Oakland with the community to establish  feasibility and sustainability of delivery, 2) A randomized controlled tria  comparing youth who only attend a CWG (n=100) to youth who attend a CWG plus  receive MICUNAY (n=100). We will compare outcomes at 3- and 6-month follow-up  to determine (a) whether clinically significant changes in AOD expectancies,  perceived prevalence of peer AOD use, alcohol consumption, marijuana and other  drug use, and related consequences occur; (b) whether clinically significant  changes in physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being a well as  spirituality and cultural identification occur, and (c) if reductions occur,  estimate effec sizes for the CWG group and the CWG plus MICUNAY group. Our  study substantially extends work with AI/AN youth by intervening at both the  community and individual level, and developing and testing an integrated  tradition-based AOD MI group intervention for urban AI/AN youth.                    </p>

                        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research  fulfills the NIAAA's mission to address health disparities by reducing alcohol  use and improving academic outcomes in a high-risk population of American  Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Tribal College and University (TCU) students  through implementation and evaluation of a low cost screening and brief  intervention (SBI). The Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College  Students (BASICS), an SBI pioneered and tested by UW investigators on this  study, represents a cost effective means to reduce alcohol use. A college-  level intervention for policy and systems change will also be tested aimed at:  (1) instituting a harm reduction policy that supports a shift from zero  tolerance alcohol policies, (2) integrating behavioral health resources for the  benefit of high-risk TCU students, and, (3) ensuring TCU SBI implementation  fidelity. BASICS has reduced alcohol consumption and consequences in mainstream  colleges and this proposal would, using a Community- based Participatory  Research approach, provide a cultural contextualization of BASICS and test this  intervention for the first time in AIAN TCU students. The specific aims are to  adapt, manualize and implement a culturally contextualized version of BASICS:  (a) To test whether a culturally appropriate BASICS intervention will surpass a  wait list control condition by significantly reducing indices of hazardous or  harmful drinking and alcohol-related negative consequences; (b) To test the  effect of the intervention in significantly improving retention and academic  performance among TCU students; and, (2) Implement a system-level policy  intervention moving from zero-tolerance to harm reduction policies at the  college-level and providing capacity to integrate services for improved  referral and treatment for high risk TCU students to test whether an  environmental approach will positively impact the SBI intervention and its  outcomes. This study's primary hypothesis is that a culturally contextualized  adaptation of SBI, as identified by the TCU/AIHEC/UW partnership, will surpass  a wait list control condition in reducing hazardous or harmful drinking and  alcohol- related negative consequences and improve academic outcomes, with a  significantly greater effect in TCU with the policy intervention.               	  </p>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
   		        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past 10 years we have focused on addressing two interrelated public health issues, alcohol use disorder (AUD) and suicide in 12-18 year old Yup'ik Alaska Natives (AN). AUD and suicide are among the leading causes of mortality among AN people and a significant health disparity in contrast to the U.S. general population (1). AN mortality rates from all alcohol-induced disorders between 2001 2005 were 53.8/100,000 in contrast to 6.3/100,000 for other ethnic groups in Alaska (2), while the age-adjusted rate for suicide is twice the national average (3). Overall, between 1960-95 AN suicide rates increased approximately 500% (4). More recent data indicate continuation of these trends and also identify cluster suicide behavior as a feature of AN youth suicide (5). Yup'ik community leaders have made addressing AUD and suicide among their highest priorities. In response, working with several communities, a community-based and led intervention (Qungasvik - toolbox) was designed. The intervention is designed to develop protective factors that will ultimately reduce the incidence of AUD and suicide. Our research leading up to the currently proposed study has shown that it is possible to: (1) deliver the intervention in remote rural communities; (2) obtain valid and reliable measures of two ultimate outcomes (i.e., Reflective Processes regarding alcohol consequences and Reasons for Life) and intermediate protective factors variables that underlie them; (3) show a dose-response effect: the more intervention sessions a person attends (dose) the stronger the measured protective factors (response); and (4) obtain a maximum protective effect from the intervention by lengthening the duration of the intervention from one to two years. The proposed study is an assessment of a modified version of the intervention and focuses on three specific aims (SA): (SA1) test Qungasvik intervention efficacy through impact on the two protective factors and to link those measures to direct measures of alcohol use and suicidal ideation; (SA2) examine the mechanisms of change in response to the intervention through growth in: (a) intermediate outcome measures of protective factors at the individual, family, peer, and community level; (b) social network characteristics of supportive relationships with elders, immediate and extended kinship relations, and community adults and describe social network change; and (c) using qualitative interviewing and grounded theory analysis techniques, describe process and impact of the intervention from community elder and parent perspectives; and (SA3) examine the fidelity of implementing the intervention.</p></div>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
               		    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problematic  substance use is widespread in many American Indian communities, and early  adolescence is a critical period for the development of subsequent substance  problems. Efforts to prevent early substance abuse are ongoing on many  reservations but often are not informed by scientific evidence of effectiveness  - largely because such evidence is sorely lacking. We propose to partner with a  reservation community with high rates of substance problems to adapt,  implement, and rigorously evaluate a program designed to prevent early  initiation of substance use and the myriad of problems that accompany early  use. The identification of early substance use as a target and the selection of  the particular intervention approach we propose have directly resulted from a  longstanding university-tribal community relationship and, in particular, from  community input within the context of two recent projects funded by NIDA  (RC4DA029974, Whitesell &amp; Beals, PIs; and R01DA027665, Whitesell, PI). A  clear message arising out of both projects has been the need to engage families  and culture in the prevention of early onset substance use. In this project, we  will continue this partnership to translate a rigorously evaluated  evidence-based practice for use with tribal families, adapting and anchoring it  within a cultural practice arising from within the community. We will draw on  the strengths of both university and community partners, implementing  innovative intervention development methods within a community collaborative  research and evaluation context. We will address three specific aims: 1.  Develop a culturally grounded, family-based early substance use prevention intervention  tailored to a Northern Plains American Indian Reservation. &quot;Use an evidence-based practice approach  to implement a proven program (Iowa Strengthening Families Program/ISFP) within a new context,  working with community partners to translate ISFP for the local context, including deep and  meaningful adaptations in how the curricular content is delivered. &quot;Use a practice-based evidence approach  to integrate a cultural curriculum (Seven Directions/SD) developed within the community into the ISFP  curriculum, drawing on local knowledge of effective practices to further ground substance use  prevention efforts within the cultural context. 2. Pilot the adapted Seven  Directions for Stronger Families (SDSF) program to determine feasibility,  refine details, and maximize fit within  the community. 3. Use the principles of the Multiphase Optimization Strategy  (MOST) for intervention evaluation and  development, to determine the relative effect size of different  intervention components and inform a final  SDSF program that balances effectiveness and efficiency. 4. Set the  stage for broad implementation of SDSF by the tribal health administration and  a randomized controlled trial of the  full intervention.               	                                       	  </div>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inhalants pose a  particularly dangerous risk to middle-school youth, and American Indian (AI)  youth are at particular risk for inhalant use. We have found over the course of  more than three decades that inhalant use among AI youth is consistently higher  than that of other ethnic/racial groups. Although inhalant use rates for AI  youth gradually declined from a peak of 31% in 1984 through 2004, our data show  a substantial increase in lifetime prevalence of inhalants among AI 7th - 12th  grade youth -- from 10% to 25%. Schools  are often the site for adolescent drug prevention efforts, but results from  these efforts are often modest or even disappointing. This intervention adapts  an existing campaign (Be under Your Own Influence; BUYOI) that has been found  to be effective in reducing substance use and that uses campaign messages that  are congruent with AI culture. The intervention will be adapted using  significant contributions from tribal members, including youth, teachers,  parents, elders, and other community members. This proposal includes active  involvement of local advisory boards, hiring of a local AI liaison, focus  groups, a youth photo voice component, and use of AI staff from our Center and  from the Native American Cultural Center at our university. The adapted anti-inhalant communications  campaign will be delivered by selected high school students to 7th grade  students. A distinguishing feature of the BUYOI campaign is a message that  targets outcome expectations related to aspirations, autonomy, and physical  harms. The campaign will use multiple channels of communication including print  (e.g., posters and fliers), video and audio spots, presentations, and social  media to deliver messages that are designed to alter outcome expectancies,  intentions, and ultimately inhalant use among targeted youth. The campaign will be delivered to two cohorts  of 7th graders, with 4 longitudinal measurement occasions for each cohort.  Seven middle schools (and their corresponding high schools) have been recruited  for the study, where four of these will be randomly assigned to the  intervention condition and three to the control condition. Multilevel data  analysis will test for effects of campaign exposure on autonomy, aspirations,  perceived harm, and intentions to use.  Because of the heavy involvement of the school and community in the  development and delivery of the intervention, we will be able to incorporate  sustainability into the design of all integrated components. Ultimately, our  goal is to develop a turnkey package for the broader population of  reservation-based AI youth and schools and to develop components that can  incorporate flexibility and creativity in their delivery. For example, a school  or local group may implement the campaign in its original form or they may  modify aspects to make them more pertinent to their community.               	  </p>

                      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse among American  Indians (AI) is a critical health disparity and accounts for many life-  threatening and deadly problems such as accidents, chronic liver disease,  cirrhosis, homicide, and suicide. The high rate of substance abuse found among  AI adolescents is believed to be associated with a variety of environmental and  historical factors. These include poverty, historical trauma, bi-cultural  stress, and changing tribal and family roles. There are few evaluated programs  addressing early adolescent AI substance abuse. Tribal communities must be  actively engaged in program development and implementation to ensure cultural  relevance and sustainability of prevention programs. This project proposes to  evaluate an after-school substance abuse prevention intervention, the  Intertribal Talking Circle (ITC), targeting 6th grade AI youth in three AI  communities: Ojibwe/Chippewa in Minnesota, Choctaw in Oklahoma, and Lumbee in  North Carolina. A community-based participatory research approach will be used  to culturally and technologically adapt the ITC. A two-condition controlled  study will evaluate the efficacy of the ITC to increase AI youth Native self-  reliance while decreasing AI youth substance use involvement. An adult training  program second level intervention study is also proposed to train tribal  personnel from the three regional tribes on how to implement the Intertribal  Talking Circle intervention as a tribl program beyond the study period.  Effectiveness will be determined by a small partial cross-over randomized trial  comparing ITC intervention to a Wait-List Control (WLC) condition. Process  evaluations will focus on the future adoption and implementation of the ITC,  and recommendations for sustainable adaptations. The project will also build AI  capacity to address health disparities, as experienced Native investigators  will mentor three Junior Native Investigators.</p>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
               		    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With substance abuse  concerns plaguing tribal communities, health preventive approaches for American  Indian (AI) children need urgent attention. Mainstream programs fall short by  failing to speak to AI children on their own terms. Not so with the Family  Listening/Circle Program (FL/CP) which integrates an evidence-based  family-strengthening core, with cultural values and practices for 4th graders,  their parents and elders? Through previous Native American Research Centers for  Health funding (Indian Health Service &amp; National Institutes of Health  partnership) the FL/CP was created and piloted by community-based participatory  research (CBPR) partnerships between the University of New Mexico Center for  Participatory Research and three tribal communities: Pueblo of Jemez, Ramah  Band of Navajo and Mescalero Apache Nation. FL/CP fills a gap in substance  abuse prevention by recapturing historic traditions of cultural transmission,  such as family dinner story <br>
               		    telling where elders connect with children, supporting  enhanced child-family communication and psycho-social coping through  traditional dialogue, indigenous languages and empowerment where children and  families create community action projects addressing community substance abuse.  With initial FL/CP pilot and feasibility research completed, Tribal Research  Teams (TRTs) from the Pueblo of Jemez, Ramah Band of Navajo and Mescalero  Apache Nation are now in place for full program implementation and  effectiveness testing through a longitudinal quasi-experimental design  involving a long-term, multi-tribal/academic research partnership. Under this  five-year R01 effectiveness trial, tribal partners are committed to assessing  the program's effectiveness and disseminating the approach and intervention  within Indian Country as a best practice in reducing substance abuse health  disparities, with TRTs collaborating on all research activities,  implementation, interpretation/analysis, and dissemination plans. Three  specific aims are 1) To rigorously test effectiveness of FLCP; with a  comparative longitudinal design within and across the tribes, with 4th graders  to prevent substance initiation/use and strengthen families; 2) Through CBPR,  support TRTs to transform their research capacities into local prevention  research infrastructures and partnering; 3) To assess additional program  effects on other health/education programs and leadership within the tribes. In  sum, this multi-tribal/academic partnership builds on accomplishments to test  the effectiveness of an innovative intervention. This grant provides an  unparalleled opportunity to reduce substance abuse in three tribal communities,  strengthen tribal research capacities, and impact substance abuse prevention  research designs nationally, by illustrating how CBPR processes can integrate  evidence-based and cultural-centered practices to create effective programs  that generate community ownership and sustainability.</p>

           		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
       		      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and substance abuse are  increasingly prevalent, costly, and deadly--fueling a twin epidemic in the  United States. The importance of addressing obesity and alcohol and other drug  (AOD) use simultaneously is supported in part by recent research at NIDA  linking the brain mechanisms that fuel drug addiction and compulsive eating  behaviors. Although AOD abstention and abuse patterns vary considerably by  region and tribe, American Indian (AI) drug-related deaths are 1.5 times higher  than for all other ethnic groups in the US. AI women in particular exhibit  significant disparities with other women in obesity and AOD prevalence and  higher rates of premature mortality and morbidity as a result. Based on  preliminary research, we have developed the Yappalli Choctaw Road to Health, a  culturally focused, strengths-based outdoor experiential obesity-AOD risk  prevention and health leadership program. The 3-month intervention (i.e., 3  individual meetings; 8 group-sessions + 2-day culture boot camp + 10-day  Choctaw Trail of Tears walk) is grounded in the PI's Indiginest Stress-Coping  Model and the Information-Motivational- Behavioral Skills framework, with  activities consistent with Motivational Interviewing and leadership development  principles. This RO1 application, prepared in response to PAR-11-346  (Interventions for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Native American  Populations), proposes to evaluate the program among 150 at-risk adult Choctaw  women across 5 regions of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma (CNO), where Native  women have some of the highest obesity, physical inactivity, and excessive  drinking prevalence in the country. We will conduct a longitudinal study using  a cluster randomized stepped-wedge design to evaluate the intervention impact  on the AOD and obesity prevention primary aims of: (1) substance use harm  reduction (SUHR) and AOD use and intentions to use; and (2) reduction in  weight/BMI and increase in leisure-time physical activity and healthful food  habits. The project is multidisciplinary community-based participatory research  collaboration among experienced AI researchers at the Universities of  Washington and Minnesota and Choctaw behavioral health leaders and providers. A  unique feature of the proposed project is its direction at both the university  and tribal levels by Choctaws. The project is supported by pilot and tribal  acceptability data; addresses a critical public health issue among a group  experiencing considerable health disparities; and strengthens the research  infrastructure in partnership with the Tribe. If efficacious, it has the  potential for widespread dissemination and could be generalizable to other  chronic co-occurring mental health and physical health conditions (e.g.,  diabetes and depression).</p></div>

               		  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
   		        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks funding for a multi-reservation randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a popular, widely disseminated, substance abuse prevention program targeted at Anishinabe (Ojibwe) preadolescents aged 8-10 years, their parents/caretakers, and extended family adults who have daily influence over the target child's behaviors. The Bii-Zin-Da-De-Dah (BZDDD) (Listening to One Another) program was the first American Indian (AI) adaptation of the Iowa Strengthening Families Program. Now in its third generation, BZDDD has been adapted for Dakota, Lakota, Pueblo, and Navajo cultures and is currently the center piece of a Canadian national Indigenous mental health promotion funded by Public Health Agency of Canada. Although BZDDD has been extremely popular at the grassroots level and has been adapted to numerous cultures there has never been a large-scale empirical evaluation of the program's efficacy for reducing adolescent alcohol and drug use. Our overall goal is to implement a RCT of a fourth-generation BZDDD prevention program that can be replicated cross-culturally by other North American Indigenous cultures to decrease substance use among early adolescents and improve mental health outcomes. This goal will be accomplished through four specific aims: 1) Complete a final adaptation of the 14-week BZDDD prevention program for the U.S. reservations; 2) Implement a RCT of BZDDD to assess its efficacy for delaying and/or preventing adolescent onset of alcohol and drug use; 3) Empirically address cultural challenges for RCTs involving Indigenous cultures by evaluating contamination and informal diffusion in communities and extended families; and 4) Work with our Anishinabe research partners to develop a plan to sustain the prevention. Using intent to treat design, the RCT will involve 255 treatment and 255 waitlist control families who live on or near five Anishinabe reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. There will be a pretest and initial post-test, with subsequent 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 month follow-ups, thus evaluating the target children through the critical years of substance use initiation. The proposed RCT will leave behind an empirically-based, family-centered prevention program that is easily woven into existing tribal social and health services or school settings. It also will be a template for adaptation to other Indigenous cultures.</p></div>

                      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children are considered gifts and  play a central role in American Indian (AI) culture. However, AI children are  at elevated risk for experiencing poverty, parental mental health disorders,  household exposure to substance use, domestic violence, and maltreatment, all  of which increase their risk of poor mental and physical health outcomes as  adolescents and adults. Virtually no evidence-based programs exist that can be  administered in a resource-poor tribal setting, can be culturally adapted, can  be exported, and hold promise for sustainability. The needs of these vulnerable  AI children, thus, remain almost entirely unmet. Decades of research have shown  that secure attachment in infancy and early childhood is a key developmental  building block that predicts adjustment and promotes resilience in children who  grow up under stressful circumstances. Because secure attachment develops from  caregiver sensitivity and responsiveness, it is critical to address caregiver  sensitivity in early childhood. We will, therefore, test the Promoting First  Relationships (PFR) program, a theoretically driven, relationship- and  strengths-based primary prevention program. Several studies have shown the  diverse positive effects of PFR on the caregiver-child relationship for at-risk  populations. The University of Washington Partnerships for Native Health have  nurtured a strong, long term collaboration with the Fort Peck Tribes, whose  reservation lies in a remote area of northeastern Montana. The tribes' Elders  Involved Initiative has stated that the health and well-being of children and  young adults are their primary concern, recommending a return to traditional  parenting values. With our tribal partner, we will adapt PFR to ensure cultural  appropriateness, then conduct a randomized, controlled trial to compare the PFR  intervention with a control group receiving information on resources and  referrals. Our primary purpose is to test the effectiveness of PFR in improving  the caregiver's sensitivity to the child (primary outcome). We will also  examine child attachment security to the caregiver and the child's social and emotional  functioning. Our specific aims are to 1) adapt the PFR intervention using focus  groups; 2) assess the adequacy of training by examining the pre- and  post-training attitudes and consultation strategies used by community-based PFR  providers with caregivers and infants; and 3) compare the PFR and control group  on caregivers' sensitivity and responsiveness and children's social and  emotional competencies and attachment security. Effective primary preventive  interventions are critically needed for AI children who grow up under stressful  circumstances. By promoting sensitive caregiving and child attachment security,  we can minimize the impact of contextual stressors on children living on the  Fort Peck reservation and, foster resilience, and improve their risk outlook.</p>                                      	</div>

               		  <p> <strong>Abstract<br>
       		    </strong>DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical need exists for  efficient community-based interventions aimed at reduction of environmental  exposures relevant to health. Biomass smoke exposures due to residential wood  heating are common among rural Native American communities, and such exposures  have been associated with respiratory disease in susceptible populations. In  many of these communities wood stoves are the most economic and traditionally  preferred method of residential heating, but resource scarcity can result in  burning of improper wood fuels and corresponding high levels of indoor  particulate matter. In response to the funding announcement &quot;Interventions  for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Native American  Populations&quot; (PAR-11-346), we propose a two-level intervention strategy to  reduce exposure to indoor biomass smoke among elderly tribal members in two  reservation communities: Nez Perce and Navajo Nation. Community-based  participatory research techniques will be used to adapt intervention approaches  to meet the cultural context of each participating community. At the community  level, we will facilitate local development of a tribal agency-led wood bank  program ensuring that elderly and/or persons with need have access to dry wood  for heating. At the household level, we will use a three arm randomized  placebo-controlled intervention trial to implement and assess  education/outreach on best burn practices (Tx1). The content and delivery  strategies of the education intervention will be adapted to each community  according to stakeholder input. This educational intervention will be evaluated  against an indoor air filtration unit arm (Tx2), as well as a placebo arm (Tx3,  sham air filters). Tx3 will be used in comparison with the other two treatment  arms to evaluate the penetration and efficacy of the community-level wood bank  program. Outcomes will be evaluated with respect to changes in pulmonary  function measures and respiratory symptoms and conditions among household  elders. We hypothesize that locally-designed education-based interventions at  the community and household levels will result in efficacious and sustainable  strategies for reducing personal exposures to indoor particulate matter, and  lead to respiratory health improvements in elderly Native populations. This  study will advance knowledge of cost-effective environmental interventions  within two unique Native American communities, and inform sustainable  multi-level strategies in similar communities throughout the US to improve  respiratory health among at-risk populations.</div>
