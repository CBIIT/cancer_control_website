      <p>With over 9 million cancer survivors alive today, cancer survivorship   represents a shift from just extending the quantity of life to also ensuring a   high quality of life. Cancer survivorship is a relatively new term which   encompasses issues that cancer patients and survivors face relating to the   physical, emotional and practical effects of cancer. On a national level,   survivorship is beginning to be addressed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)   through the Office of Cancer Survivorship and also by the Centers for Disease   Control and Prevention (CDC). These initiatives are part of the national   healthcare goal of &ldquo;Healthy People 2010&rdquo; and NCI&rsquo;s goal to &ldquo;eliminate the   suffering and death due to cancer by 2015.&rdquo; The topic of National Priorities in   Addressing Cancer Survivorship interested me because of the variance in services   at cancer centers and community hospitals where cancer patients are treated.   Change on a national level will improve care in many communities. Also, my work   at the Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF) where the main focus is survivorship is   another reason for my interest in this topic.</p>

      Survivorship is   important because as Dr. Julia Rowland, director of the Office of Cancer   Survivorship at NCI, said, &ldquo;Survivors may be cancer free, but may not be free of   their cancer.&rdquo; Once cured, cancer survivors are burdened with the long-term   fears of having cancer as well as the practical—in the workplace or when   searching for health insurance. As more people diagnosed with cancer are cured,   the long-term effects of treatment must be understood and monitored   appropriately. At the national level, this can be achieved through research,   development of treatment and follow-up guidelines, intervention development,   development of a medical record database, and changes in law. A new document   produced by the CDC in conjunction with the LAF, the National Action Plan for   Cancer Survivorship, outlines steps for the public health community to address   cancer survivorship. The plan is a great starting point toward adequately   addressing the needs of cancer survivors.
      <p>At the conference I came to a few conclusions and formed a few opinions of my   own. I found that interest in survivorship is slowly evolving through the   development of research grants by NIH and NCI (and grants from organizations   like the LAF!). While it is easy to study and understand the long-term physical   outcomes of treatment, it is quite difficult to study the emotional or   psychosocial effects and the benefit of an intervention. The biggest obstacle   for survivorship is in determining the value of quality of life. I think that   many researchers and policy makers do not quite understand the need for   survivorship research. While still very important, most scientists are still   solely focused on development of a cure. In order to truly address the issue of   survivorship I feel that more participation from physicians needs to be   solicited since they are the direct contact to patients. At this conference, I   only saw a few physicians and the rest were researchers with PhD&rsquo;s in various   health disciplines. However, it was encouraging to learn that the American   Society for Clinical Oncology and the American College of Surgeons were working   together to develop long-term follow-up guidelines analogous to the Children&rsquo;s   Oncology Group guidelines that were released this year. </p>
      <p>I hope to continue working with organizations such as the Lance Armstrong   Foundation to further survivorship. As a future health professional, I hope to   work with other physicians to begin to understand survivorship not only for   cancer patients but for all diseases and address the issues surrounding their   care. I am also interested in conducting research in the area of cancer   survivorship and developing a community program for survivors and caregivers. <br />
