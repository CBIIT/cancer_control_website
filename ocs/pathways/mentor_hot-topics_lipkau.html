      The content of the   Cancer Survivor-Researcher Mentor Program was extremely informative and   valuable. Of special interest to me were topics related to late effects of   cancer and its treatment and interventions to address them. As a four-time   cancer survivor over a 25 year period, I am personally interested in how late   effects are affecting my life. In my work at the Medical Center and in   outreach/advocacy activities, I know the information will be valuable to other   survivors as well as the health professionals with whom I   interact.<br />
      <br />
      Learning about the risks of secondary cancers, cognitive and   memory problems, and psychosocial and family issues was significant. Knowing   that my last cancer diagnosis 3 years ago may be a late effect of previous   cancers that occurred 15 and 20 years earlier, was both disturbing and somewhat   relieving for me; we wonder, &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;What can I do to prevent this from   happening again?&quot; It is gratifying to know that researchers are interested in   these issues and working to find answers, or at least ways to assist those   experiencing secondary cancers. To have the additional problems (cognitive,   memory, depression, psychosocial, and physical) recognized and validated is so   helpful when dealing with those who are troubled and think they are alone after   their cancer experiences.<br />
      <br />
      I was especially impacted by some of the   suggestions brought about by the studies. Of special interest to me was that a   surveillance program needs to be in place after cancer treatment. Three years   ago my diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with metastasis to both ovaries resulted   in surgery, a year-long clinical trial protocol of chemotherapy, and two   additional surgeries—the final Whipple procedure which changed the diagnosis   from pancreatic cancer to duodenal adenocarcinoma. The only follow up I was   given was a follow up appointment, one year later, with the surgeon who said,   &quot;You&rsquo;re doing great. Send me a card once in awhile!&quot; My local oncologist where   my chemo was administered told me to give him a call &quot;if something comes up.&quot;   Gaining the knowledge from the information at the conference that I should have   a surveillance plan has given me the motivation to call my oncologist and   discuss some type of structured follow-up schedule. I have also shared this with   members of the cancer support group that I facilitate. <br />
      <br />
      Changing the   focus from finding cures (although this is still critically important) to   assisting survivors on how to live with cancer and possible late effects can be   difficult to sell. Survivors want to go through their therapies and put the   cancer behind them; then, when they experience a recurrence or emotional issues   that occur, they are devastated and often find themselves unable to cope with   facing treatment again. Comparing cancer to a chronic disease can be difficult   for some, but seems to be going in the direction of &quot;acceptance&quot; for many as the   numbers of long-term survivors grow. For me, having worked with survivors as a   volunteer for the American Cancer Society for 23 years and at my job for 12   years, I know that these experiences helped me deal with new diagnoses. For   example, I cope with some cognitive &quot;chemo-brain&quot; problems and try to share   these experiences with my constituents in order to help them cope, as well. I   feel that support groups and one-on-one volunteer survivors are imperative to   enhancing quality of life for survivors.<br />
      <br />
      As some presenters expressed,   getting survivors back into society—work, social activities, etc.—can be   challenging. So many of the survivors I interact with feel isolated and confused   about what direction they should go, especially if they are not ready to return   to work or are retired. My plan is to institute a survivor volunteer program and   train these survivors to &quot;buddy&quot; with newly diagnosed and/or recurrence patients   and provide them with the benefit of their experience, which I know from my own   situation helps the giver as much as the receiver. One of the poster session   presenters at the conference offered me her assistance, since she has such a   program in place at her workplace which will be invaluable to me in my pursuit.   My hospital has already approved the plan!<br />
      <br />
      I believe that being <em>AWARE</em> without being overly <em>ALARMED</em> about the late effects of   cancer and its treatment is the message I want to promote. Also the enormous   amount of research, study, and focus the NCI, OCS, ACS, and LAF as well as all   the research institutions are placing on the issues of survivorship are most   encouraging and can truly enhance quality of life for cancer survivors.<br />
