                          Major treatment   advances for childhood cancer occurred during the 20th century. Today more than   70 percent of children are cured of their cancer. As more children survive, the   impact of late effects from cancer treatment presents new challenges for   caregivers. The focus for the 21st century shifts as oncologists work to cure   children with cancer, <em>while at the same time</em>, strive to minimize late   effects so that survivors may have the best opportunity for quality of life.   This is challenging particularly for children treated for leukemia and CNS   tumors, who are at the greatest risk for cognitive late effects from their   treatment. Each year in the United States, approximately 12,500 children and   adolescents are diagnosed with cancer, with leukemia and CNS tumors accounting   for the largest percentage of all pediatric cancers.1
                          <p>The cognitive impact is uniquely significant in terms of its duration of   impact on length cancer&rsquo;s youngest patients. For example, a child diagnosed with   leukemia who completes two years of therapy can face, at 7 years old, decades of   cognitive impairment from his or her cancer treatment. Chemotherapy and/or   radiation can result in mild to severe effects on developing brains, especially   for children under 5 years of age at time of treatment. It is a devastating   consequence of cancer treatment for patients and families who endure years of   treatment to subsequently face this late effect of therapy. </p>
                          <p>Identification, discussion and appropriate remediation/intervention programs   for at-risk children should begin at diagnosis. In this way parents can be   better informed and prepared to address treatment-related cognitive deficits.   Remediation/intervention programs can be introduced to patients during treatment   and well before difficult learning strategies are adapted by the patient.   Children may adopt ineffective learning styles in an effort to keep up with   their peers in the classroom. As the academic degree of difficulty increases   through grade levels, the goal of keeping up becomes more elusive and adversely   impacts survivors&rsquo; self-esteem and confidence. If, however, at risk patients are   provided with appropriate remediation/intervention, either during or at the   conclusion of treatment, it would equip the child with the tools and skills to   better manage their treatment-related cognitive impairment. <br />
                            <br />
                            The   presentations in the Neurocognitive Functioning session described a number of   promising developments on the horizon. Dr. Ida Moore, of the University of   Arizona, showcased <strong>Math Interventions for Children with   Leukemia</strong>. In this study, children treated for acute lymphoblastic   leukemia (ALL) who had declining performances in math receive 40 to 50 hours of   a skill based math intervention. Early indications provided evidence of a   substantial improvement in math skills. Dr. Moore&rsquo;s group is pursuing the   introduction of math intervention during ALL therapy and expanding enrollment to   include patients treated for brain tumors. Their work is also underway to   determine the mechanisms of effect of therapy on the CNS that leads to cognitive   injury. It is especially significant to note that these researchers were able to   capture baseline pre-treatment performance scores, something that is rarely   done, and yet is so important to assessing therapy&rsquo;s cognitive impact. </p>
                          <p>Dr. Raymond Mulhern, of St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Hospital, presented <strong>Short-Term Efficacy of Methylphenidate (MPH) Among Survivors of   Childhood Cancer </strong>for children treated for ALL and CNS tumors. MPH is a   psychostimulant widely used to treat patients with attention deficit   hyperactivity disorder. In children who experienced attention-related issues,   use of MPH resulted in marked improvements in attention, as well as, but to a   lesser extent, social behavior in this group of childhood cancer survivors. It   is notable that 80 percent of participants chose to continue treatment with MPH   at the end of the study. Further research will focus on dosage efficacy and side   effects. </p>
                          <p>On the adult side, the <strong>Memory and Attention Adaptation Training   Program (MAAT)</strong> is an intervention aimed at improving   chemotherapy-related impairment. Dr. Robert Ferguson, of Dartmouth Medical   School, described the advantages of a short, cognitive-behavioral intervention   to address memory and attention issues in adult survivors. Participants   expressed satisfaction with the intervention and improvements in a number of   areas, including memory and cognitive functioning, which positively affected   overall quality of life. </p>
                          <p>As a parent whose son was treated for leukemia, I sought out another   NCI-funded cognitive remediation program developed by Dr. Robert Butler of the   Oregon Health and Science University&rsquo;s Doernbecher Children&rsquo;s Hospital. My son   participated in this remediation program, and I can attest to how critical such   programs are to future academic and social adjustment and success of at-risk   children. Dr. Butler&rsquo;s multi-center study was designed for children treated for   leukemia and brain tumors and works to engrain learning strategies children can   employ in the classroom and in their every day lives to enhance attention,   information processing, organization, and multi-tasking, and thus better their   quality of life.</p>
                          <p>The emergence of cognitive remediation/intervention programs to counter   cognitive late effects should become the standard of care for at-risk patients.   These programs should be the rule, not the rare exception, at treating   institutions. The interventions presented here are a premier example of NCI&rsquo;s   commitment to funding programs that allow for cancer&rsquo;s youngest patients to   attain and maintain academic achievement.</p>
