      The number of cancer   survivors—you are a survivor from diagnosis until the end of your life—has grown   from approximately 3 million in 1971 to almost 10 million in 2001. With advances   in treatment, the increase of cancer diagnoses with age, and the aging of   America&rsquo;s population, we can expect the numbers of diagnoses and survivors to   continue to rise. Sixty-four percent of adults diagnosed with cancer today will   be alive 5 years from now and the 10-year survival rate for children is   approaching 75 percent.
      <p>The National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Office of Cancer Survivorship was established   in 1996 to focus on improving the length and quality of life for our growing   survivor population. Research sponsored by the Office of Cancer Survivorship has   been documenting a number of physical, psychosocial and economic &ldquo;late effects&rdquo;   of cancer treatment and looking for ways to prevent or treat these effects to   improve life for survivors. Equally important is building a knowledge base for   survivors and healthcare providers that will help them identify and address   these late effects and optimize health after cancer treatment. These issues not   only impact quality of life for survivors, they also impact the lives of their   families or partners.</p>
      <p>In many cancer centers, once treatment has been completed, oncology   caregivers expect to be involved only in follow up checkups or in the event of a   recurrence or second cancer. It often falls to primary care or pediatric   physicians and nurse practitioners to recognize and deal with late effects of   cancer and its treatment. Cancer survivors themselves also need to be aware of   late effects and their symptoms to help them understand what may be happening   when they experience a symptom, so that they can raise the question with their   physician or nurse practitioner. Screening tests will play an important role as   well in identifying late effect issues. For example, it has been common to   provide hearing tests prior to chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin to   establish a baseline against which post-treatment tests can be measured to   assess the impact of chemotherapy. Testing to establish baselines will need to   be expanded to facilitate assessment of the impact of cancer and cancer   treatments on quality of life and it will need to be covered by insurance. </p>
      <p>The reality for cancer survivors is that symptoms present at diagnosis may or   may not disappear after treatment. Side effects which are largely viewed as   lingering for a short time after treatment may or may not continue. Late effects   may appear months or years after treatment. The good news is that these issues   are now being recognized and addressed. Information is being gathered about   symptoms and linked symptoms (symptom clusters) and treatments are being   explored.</p>
      <p>The links between cancer treatment and pain are not always easy to identify   since pain is also present with arthritis, heart disease, injury, neurological   problems, infection, etc. Fatigue is frequently an acute side effect of cancer   treatment, but it is also a symptom of arthritis, heart failure, multiple   sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, HIV, anemia, renal failure, lung disease,   infection, stroke, etc. The impact of fatigue on quality of life can be   significant. Depression often comes with illness, pain, and fatigue, which last   for extended periods of time. Sufferers from fatigue find they can do less, that   everything takes longer, that they have problems thinking and concentrating and   that they make more mistakes. Fatigue may affect family income and is certain to   affect family relationships.</p>
      <p>Some longer term effects of cancer treatment such as fear of recurrence,   lymphedema, sexual dysfunction, and second cancers are more readily linked to   the patient&rsquo;s cancer and/or its treatment. The links are harder to establish   with certainty for problems such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, social or   professional insecurity, depression, cognitive loss and memory problems. Many of   these latter symptoms also occur as part of the aging process. Researchers are   working to prove that late affects from aggressive cancer treatment can   accelerate or intensify aging symptoms in older patients. Perhaps research can   establish normal ranges of aging symptoms and then be able to better measure the   impact of cancer and its treatment. Such impact is much more readily identified   in children and young adults where symptoms of aging are not a factor. With a   75% rate for survival for 10 years, children represent a significant survivor   population where quality of life issues have a longer term impact. </p>
      <p>The two most important issues for improving quality of life for cancer   survivors are continuing to fund research and raising awareness among healthcare   professionals and among patient and family populations. Research will increase   our understanding of the ways in which cancer and cancer treatment can impact   quality of life for survivors. It will also help clinicians to develop   strategies and treatments for coping with these issues. Not all solutions will   involve great expense. It has recently been noted, when treating breast, lung   and other chest cancers with radiation—depending on the path of radiation during   treatment—that simply having the patient take a deep breath and hold it during   radiation can move the heart out of the path of the radiation treatment. This   discovery provides a perfect example of a way to reduce cardiac risk while   pointing out the importance of raising awareness. </p>
      <p>Research into ways to treat cancer that focus on tumor growth triggers and   take advantage of genetic discoveries holds great promise for treatments that   are more effective and less toxic and damaging than the ones we depend on today.   In the meantime, researchers are identifying the late effects of treatment and   coming up with ways to prevent or ameliorate them. All of this means enhanced   quality of life for cancer survivors and their families.<br />
