                          <p>Board President, Colon Cancer Alliance<br />

                          <p>Today, there are currently 9.8 million cancer survivors in the United States.   This number has risen dramatically since 1971 and is expected to rise even more   drastically over the next decade as the vast numbers of baby boomers age and   advances in diagnostic and treatment capabilities are allowing people diagnosed   with cancer the opportunity to become survivors. </p>
                                      <p>The views and opinions expressed do not necessarily   state or reflect those of the United States Government and they may not be used   for advertising or product endorsement purposes. </p>
                                 
                        
                          Dr. Andrew von   Eschenbach, director of the National Cancer Institute, stated in his keynote   address at the Cancer Survivorship Conference, that the goal of NCI is that by   2015 there should be no death and suffering as a result of a diagnosis of   cancer.
                          <p>A lofty goal, a goal which I pray is realistic. Tremendous effort is required   to utilize fully current technologies, medical capabilities and recent research   advancements. Perhaps the greatest necessity is to eliminate societal barriers   which prevent significant populations of American citizens from benefiting fully   from the healthcare advances.</p>
                          <p>To be a cancer survivor you need two things: First, you must be living.   Second, you must have a cancer diagnosis as part of your medical history. To   achieve the goal of the NCI, all American citizens currently underserved   medically and those understudied in survivorship research must be targeted for   full inclusion. </p>
                          <p>Colon cancer, if identified and caught early, is curable. A 2003 American   Cancer Society study found that socioeconomic factors such as low educational   attainment, lack of health insurance, or lack of access to a source of health   care were associated with under-utilization of colorectal cancer   screening1. In 2000, only 39 percent of citizens age 50 or over   utilized a recommended screening method 2.</p>
                          <p>The research presented at the Cancer Survivor Conference discussed an   additional barrier of &ldquo;lack of awareness&rdquo; in utilizing the existing medical   resources. Participant researchers from Apsaalooke Reservation in Montana   described the elements required to enhance awareness and increase utilization of   healthcare, truly making a difference in their community. Specifically, they   described the importance of identifying the &ldquo;messenger,&rdquo; respected community   champions who conveyed the message, involving all aspects of community life for   venues and the means to educate and have the resources to screen, diagnose,   treat, and support within the community. </p>
                          <p>I am in a unique position and have opportunities to use what I have learned   from the conference. First, as the president of the Colon Cancer Alliance, our   organization will continue to be the voice of the colon cancer survivor,   advancing the importance of awareness and need for routine and regular   screening. This message will be delivered in communities throughout the country   as part of our grassroots &ldquo;voices&rdquo; program. </p>
                          <p>As a member of the Michigan Cancer Consortium and Colorectal Cancer Advisory   Committee, I will work on the state level to reaffirm screening expectations,   increase citizen awareness, and address inequities in access to medical care. </p>
                          <p>As the deputy executive director of Oakland County Community Mental Health   Authority in Pontiac, Michigan, I am aware of another genuinely under studied   and underserved population—the citizens who are developmentally disabled and   those recovering from chronic mental illness. In FY 05 our organizational plan   will be to advance the health care status of those we serve through increased   coordination of care, regular health examinations, and adherence to early   detection and screening guidelines. </p>
                          <p>As a colon cancer survivor, I will continue to speak and be a health   messenger to my family, my friends and my community. The message is two-fold.   First, pay attention to your body, get regular health care, and adhere to early   detection of cancer screening guidelines. Second, if you become a cancer   survivor, death is not inevitable. Life—a happy and good life—is possible to   attain. </p>
