      I am on an all too   familiar personal and first name basis with cancer. I strongly believe that I am   currently cancer free, however there is not a day that goes by that I don&rsquo;t   think about my own cancer story and/or those of others with various cancers.   This essay is based upon my experiences as a: multiple cancer survivor;   caregiver for my two best friends; urban public hospital social worker and   administrator; running a small home-IV-therapy company; cancer patient advocate   and board member of US TOO New York Prostate Cancer Survivor&rsquo;s Support Group;   and an NCI CARRA cancer patient advocate.
      <p>Cancer fighters/survivors like any other population or grouping, don&rsquo;t all   feel and react the same way. However, the common denominator of our nearly ten   million survivors (some 3.5% of United States population), perhaps most of who   were confronted with potentially life threatening diseases, does place us into a   rather unique category.</p>
      <p>In addition to the usual and customary peaks and valleys of life, cancer   fighters/survivors face a variety of unique and potentially cataclysmic   psychosocial events. These immediate and late term psychosocial events occur   more often than not in our cancer treatment, healing, and physical and spiritual   recovery.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I consider psychosocial manifestations a very real, adverse side   effect of the cancer fighter/survivor care continuum process which must be   identified, addressed and resolved as much as any other significant adverse side   effect of cancer treatment.</p>
      <p>Some of these psychosocial events may surface at or about the time of the   cancer diagnosis; some effects may only manifest or become evident later on.   Most cancer fighters/survivors' lives, psychosocially, will be forever altered   and often radically changed subsequent to cancer diagnosis, initiation of and   cessation of treatment, recovery, healing, and through to the balance of their   lives.</p>
      <p>It is crucial for the entire health care treatment and support team to be   ready to observe, process, and treat cancer fighters/survivors multiple   complicated feelings. These feelings may include: crushing and near paralyzing   anxiety, uncertainty, frustration, depression, sadness, decision making   including choice of treatment, anger and fears about efficacy and side effects   of treatment, concern about the health care treatment team, anxiety and stress   about interpersonal and sexual relationships, fatigue, sleep deprivation,   altered body image, guilt, concern about the health and wellbeing of family   members and care givers, spiritual and faith challenges, economic and employment   challenges, under-health-insured, no health insurance, logistical nightmares as   to getting to and from treatment, childcare, consequential addictive disorders   such as obesity, smoking, and alcohol, fears about recurrence and second   cancers, fearful when active treatment is completed, anxiety about physical and   emotional pain, survival, and ultimate post-treatment quality-of-life.</p>
      <p>Thus, the health care treatment team, cancer fighters/ survivors and   caregivers/supporters need to acknowledge and recognize that psychosocial   effects are more common than not, at all stages in the diagnosis, treatment,   recovery, healing and cure continuum. I advocate that all members of the health   care delivery team receive ongoing psychosocial training and in-service   education. It is essential that multiple psychosocial services be discussed and   offered in a psychologically sensitive manner. Cancer fighters/survivors should   be encouraged to accept their new panoply of feelings and to minimize worrying   that they are &ldquo;losing it&rdquo; because of their emerging feelings associated with   their cancer status. </p>
      <p>At the same time as the cancer diagnosis is being communicated to cancer   fighters/survivors, clinicians should express that some possible psychosocial   events, to a greater or lesser degree, may occur as a side effect and   consequence of cancer. The physician, social worker and mental health staff can   play a critical role at this early as well as all stages of cancer care. Mental   health workers should be available for individual consultation as well as to run   groups. </p>
      <p>Clinicians should monitor the level of stress and depression that cancer   fighters/survivors are experiencing and be ready and willing to make expeditious   referrals and treatment plans. Hopefully they will recognize, prevent and   interrupt adverse psychosocial effects.</p>
      <p>Clinicians should provide cancer specific support group information to cancer   fighters/survivors. Cancer fighters/survivors should be encouraged to think   about participating in them, from the moment of diagnosis and before treatment   begins, as well as during and post treatment. There are various mentor and peer   support models that may be helpful.</p>
      <p>Cancer fighters/survivors should be educated about Internet resources from   the National Cancer Institute and large national cancer-specific organizations.   With as much reliable information as possible, cancer survivors may be able to   further empower themselves, function proactively, and strengthen their   self-care; and hopefully minimize adverse psychosocial effects latter on in the   cancer cure continuum.</p>
      <p>Complementary approaches and stress management tools, techniques and   education early on should be provided to cancer fighters/survivors. The use of   these resources may help to calm both the body and the mind and thus may be able   to help lessen both acute and later term adverse psychosocial effects. These   adjunctive methods to mainstream care may include: expressive movement; dance   therapy; visual imaging; yoga; music and sound therapy; biofeedback; physical   fitness; relaxation, touch and massage therapies; nutrition; acupuncture; and   mindful meditation. Faith based programs, healing circles and services and   spiritual enlightenment experiences should also be offered. </p>
      <p>We must research the impact of sudden illness life-style changes, employment,   sedentary activities,; energy imbalances, and the possibility of psychosocial   disorders occurring at the time of and subsequent to the cancer diagnosis being   made. We need to research and develop psychosocial needs profiles, advance   psychosocial screening technologies and behavioral risk factors models, and   behavioral modifications in order to help cancer fighters/survivors address,   deal with, and resolve their cancer related psychosocial trauma. </p>
