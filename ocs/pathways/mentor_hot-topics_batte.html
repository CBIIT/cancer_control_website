        <p>Advocate, Cancer &amp; Leukemia Group B<br />

        <p>The overall theme assigned to this section of the conference,&rdquo; Shepherding   the Future&rdquo; was designed to give attendees an overview of the national   priorities in cancer survivorship, and the speakers aptly attained that goal.   One cannot move in the world of cancer research among other advocates without   hearing the anecdotal stories of cognitive dysfunction, concrete physical side   effects of treatments like fatigue, and other long-term health issues caused by   treatment. I was aware of the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Office of Cancer   Survivorship and its focus on issues surrounding survivorship, but if this   conference opened my eyes to the truly unique and poorly understood needs of   survivors, then this overview on priorities gave me an understanding that there   is a national resolve to address them. </p>
        <p>The three reports reviewed in this session are each comprehensive, well   prepared studies and our speakers gave us an energetic overview of each.   Listening with the ear of an advocate, I was focused on what might stand out to   a cross-section of survivors and would like to share those impressions from that   viewpoint. </p>

        <em>Living Beyond   Cancer: Finding a New Balance</em>, presented by Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, was an   overview of the 2003 annual report of the President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel, of which Dr.   Leffall is a member. The most reassuring news from this report was that the   panel traveled across the country conducting a series of meetings to both listen   and hear what challenges survivors faced in their everyday lives. I believe   using that methodology will give survivors ownership of this information. Two of   the recommendations I highlighted form the presentation are: &ldquo;Every patient   should be given a record of all care received and important disease   characteristics,&rdquo; including the names of drugs administered, how much radiation   was received and what kind of machine was used. What a simple, easily   accomplished concept! The second, that was strongly suggested in hearings of all   age groups, is that the &ldquo;Department of Health and Human Services should   establish a consortium to develop standards for creating a nationwide electronic   health records system.&rdquo; I found it interesting that the perception of the good   that might be accomplished by such a system would outweigh the fears many people   have of a breach of confidentiality. We were shown a video presentation of an   overview of the testimony of survivors and I felt it was well done and would   prove a useful tool in educating both the public and survivors about the report.
        <p><em>Summary of the Institute of Medicine Reports on Cancer Survivorship</em> was presented by Susan Weiner, Ph.D. The major theme of this report is to   improve the quality of care at the time of treatment with an eye toward possible   long term side-effects. The report focused on implications of treatment for   childhood cancers, which has led the way in many issues of long-term   survivorship and highlights a startlingly statistic:</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of all children treated for cancer have one late onset side effect   and one-fourth have a life threatening effect. These can be caused by cytotoxic   agents, surgery and/or radiation and may emerge anywhere from 6 months to many   years later. Recommendations that came to the forefront included these: Simply <strong>having</strong> guidelines for follow-up care is a first priority, and   this report found that they simply do not exist. Additionally, it is imperative   that survivors be made aware of late effects of treatments by their treating   physician, but professional training is also needed to help other health care   providers and teachers be aware of and identify possible late effects. </p>
        <p><em>State of Cancer Control Plans and Cancer Survivorship</em> was presented   by Susan True, M.Ed., and highlighted a report from the Centers for Disease   Control and Prevention titled, &ldquo;A National Action Plan for Cancer Survivorship:   Advancing Public Health Strategies.&rdquo; This report looked at survivorship as a   public health issue and asked the interesting question, &ldquo;Where does survivorship   fit into comprehensive approaches to cancer control?&rdquo; It strongly suggests that   we should be looking at outcome evaluations, not just numbers, and prompts us to   see survivorship as part of a more circular model of cancer control. In other   words, if a traditional look at survivorship is linear, beginning with   prevention and ending with palliation, a better approach might be to make it   more circular. If there is prevention and screening and then diagnosis and   treatment, shouldn&rsquo;t it be followed by survivorship education that might include   family history, genetic testing or counseling, and education on lifestyle   changes that would bring us full circle to prevention! I was very impressed with   this way of thinking; it may be a way for survivors to take ownership of their   future, something they often feel they have surrendered to their   disease. </p>
