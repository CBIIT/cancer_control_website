      As a young adult   survivor of head and neck cancer, an oncology social worker, and a cancer   survivorship advocate, it was with great interest and enthusiasm that I   participated in the first Survivor-Researcher Mentor Program of the Survivorship   Conference: Pathways to Health After Treatment. Co-sponsored by the National   Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, this meeting brought together   leading minds in the field of survivorship science, survivors, caregivers, and   advocates. Plenary sessions, breakout sessions, and poster presentations   featured the emerging science and research in cancer survivorship. Topics   included, but were not limited to, late effects of cancer and its treatment,   interventions to address them, understudied populations, and national priorities   in addressing cancer survivorship. The Lance Armstrong Foundation made it   possible for 20 (including myself) survivors, caregivers, or advocates to attend   this conference as part of the Survivor-Researcher Mentor Program, enabling us   to interact with and learn from leaders in the survivorship field. In turn, the   mentors had the opportunity to learn about the participants&rsquo; experiences as   survivors, advocates, caregivers, and health professionals. It was a unique and   enlightening experience.
      <p>As an 8-year survivor of head and neck cancer, oncology social worker, and   cancer advocate, I have experienced firsthand or through my work with patients   many of the challenges and psychosocial issues that survivors confront. Grief,   anxiety, depression, altered body image, fears of recurrence or second   malignancies, and losses in terms of previous life roles and aspirations are   just some of these, and can create significant distress. Psychological distress   was highlighted in the conference breakout session that I attended, as well as   several of the poster presentations and the President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel 2003 Annual   Report. A common theme underlying all of these is that it is important not just   that survivors live, but how they live. Quality of life in survivorship is of   great significance. As many presenters illustrated, supportive interventions and   support groups are effective and often essential tools for easing psychological   distress. In her study of psychological interventions for breast cancer patients   in the re-entry phase, Annette L. Stanton, Ph.D., from UCLA, stressed that &ldquo;one   size does not fit all&rdquo; and that the effects of interventions vary as a function   of the characteristics of the participant. Further research should be undertaken   to focus interventions on those most in need and to tailor the content to the   specific characteristics of the individuals to whom they are geared. </p>
      <p>Several poster presentations echoed this theme of tailoring specific   interventions to the characteristics of those they intend to serve. One by Anne   E. Kazak, Ph.D., of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia, on the treatment of   post-traumatic stress symptoms in adolescent survivors of childhood cancer   highlighted the need for innovative models of intervention that both reduce   symptoms and promote resiliency and competency. Another by Lora Rhodes of the   Kimmel Cancer Center illustrated the promise of one-on-one peer support as an   alternative to traditional support groups for those who otherwise could not or   would not participate in such groups. In addition to improving social and   emotional quality of life in participants, this intervention also proved to be   as acceptable or even more acceptable to men, a trend not usually seen in   traditional support groups. </p>
      <p>Another poster presented the efficacy of a telephone-based expressive writing   program for spouse/partner caregivers of hematopoietic stem cell transplant   survivors. This group often reports significant social constraint, as well as a   reluctance to share their own feelings at a time when most medical and   psychosocial attention is focused on the survivor. The expressive writing   intervention was designed with these caregiver characteristics in consideration,   and thus provided a feasible and comfortable outlet for thoughts and feelings   without social constraints, as well as a few moments devoted to their own   needs—time which they had previously been reluctant to create for themselves.   This poster, as well as the others mentioned and several others not discussed,   all reflect the importance of targeting the intervention to the specific   characteristics and needs of those it is meant to serve. As we develop and   implement supportive interventions and programs, it is essential to bear in mind   that &ldquo;one size does not fit all.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>This notion of designing supports tailored to the specific needs, concerns,   and characteristics of the recipients also relates, in my opinion, to the idea   of understudied populations—specifically, the population of young adult   survivors. While I truly believe that cancer survivors from across the life span   equally deserve research, attention, and supportive interventions, it does not   seem that the young adult survivor population has received as much focus as it   might. While it was encouraging to see that several of the sessions and posters   at this conference addressed the &ldquo;orphaned cohort,&rdquo; these presentations largely   focused on young adult survivors of childhood cancers. Research and information   on those actually diagnosed as young adults, roughly between the ages of 18-35,   was less prevalent. At a time when most are attending college or graduate   school; establishing new careers, relationships and independence; buying homes;   starting families, etc.; a cancer diagnosis proves to be an abrupt interruption   that thrusts the young adult into a tumultuous and unfamiliar world that brings   numerous concerns. Some of these include acute and long-term effects; fear of   recurrence or death; depression; altered self-esteem; fertility; dating and   relationships; and difficulty obtaining health and life insurance, employment,   and adequate follow-up surveillance. While some of these concerns overlap with   those of others across the life span, many of the challenges are specific to   this age group and assistance is often needed in navigating the foreign   territory of cancer diagnosis and survivorship. </p>
      <p>Over the past 10 years, awareness of the unique concerns facing young adult   survivors has gradually been brought to the forefront thanks to the dedication   and success of organizations such as The Lance Armstrong Foundation, the Ulman   Fund for Young Adults, Planet Cancer, Vital Options International, the Young   Survival Coalition and Fertile Hope. Still, though, more can be done to heighten   awareness and develop supportive interventions and programs, particularly at the   institutional and community levels. Sometimes it takes connection to a program   or person in the center or community in which a young adult is being treated for   him or her to learn about helpful organizations such as these. Programs and   services directly geared toward the specific needs of young adult survivors   should be available at health care institutions and community levels, serving as   first-line supports and liaisons to the other essential organizations that I   have mentioned above. As a young adult survivor, advocate, and oncology social   worker, I plan to continue to develop, support, and encourage such programs and   supportive interventions within my own institution and community to continue to   address and heighten awareness of the unique needs and challenges confronted by   those diagnosed with cancer as young adults.<br />
