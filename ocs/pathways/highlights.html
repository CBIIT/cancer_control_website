      <p><strong><strong>Cancer Survivorship:   Pathways to Health After Treatment: Conference   Highlights</strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Co-sponsored by: The Office of Cancer Survivorship (OCS), Division of   Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), National Cancer Institute (NCI),   National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Behavioral Research Program,   American Cancer Society (ACS)</strong></p>
      <p>The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s co-sponsored   meeting, Cancer Survivorship: Pathways to Health After Treatment, was held at   the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel, in Washington, DC. The meeting was attended by   researchers across multidisciplinary fields, health care professionals, federal   scientists, community-based advocates, state public health planners, and cancer   survivors and their families.</p>
      <p>Currently, 9.8 million cancer survivors reside in the United States,   accounting for 3.5 percent of the population. Among all cancer survivors in   2001, an estimated 14 percent had received a cancer diagnosis &gt;20 years ago.   The increasing number of cancer patients achieving long-term survival emphasizes   the need for a national agenda to support further research and improved followup   of patients, aimed toward understanding the long-term physical, psychosocial,   and economic effects of cancer and its treatment. Current research findings in   the areas of: (1) long-term and late effects of cancer and its treatment, (2)   status of intervention research (including the promotion of health behaviors   after cancer), (3) national priorities in cancer survivorship, and (4) the   individual and societal burden of cancer survivorship were presented.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="1" id="1"></a>I. Post Treatment Health: The   Landscape</strong><br />
        Late effects (i.e., complications or adverse   medical/health outcomes) as a result of cancer and its treatment can occur   shortly after treatment or many years later, and may affect virtually all body   systems, with long-term negative consequences for patients&rsquo; survival and   quality-of-life. The risk of long-term effects of cancer treatment is influenced   by multiple factors including the age of the patient, type of cancer, and type   of treatment received; the degree of risk to an individual patient cannot be   precisely predicted. For survivors of childhood cancer treatment, radiation   therapy and certain chemotherapies (i.e., alkylating agents and topoisomerase   inhibitors) are important determinants that may cause severe long-term damage.   Cancer treatments can affect vital organ function (e.g., heart, kidney,   endocrine), and lead to increased risk of developing second cancers. While, late   effects such as fatigue, diminished memory and concentration function, and   fertility and reproduction dysfunction are not life-threatening, they can   seriously affect survivors&rsquo; health and quality-of-life. Research designed to   understand the causes of, and risk factors for, long-term effects can result in   changes in treatment plans to lessen the negative consequences of cancer   therapy. Future studies will need to examine the interaction between treatment,   genetics, medical co-morbidities, and lifestyle choices.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>II. Post Treatment Health: The Current State of   Interventions</strong><br />
        As intervention research advances in the field of   cancer survivorship it is important to provide a framework for summarizing   accomplishments and identifying challenges and opportunities in addressing   problems of cancer survivors. Researchers should consider how the problem is   being defined, how the problem is being measured, and how the occurrence of the   problem is being studied. Some delayed effects of cancer treatment may not be   life-threatening, but nonetheless lead to decreased quality-of-life. Fatigue, in   particular, is a problem for many cancer survivors and can interfere with their   usual activities and affect social interactions, physical well-being, and job   performance, sometimes with serious economic consequences. </p>
      <p>Encouraging healthy behaviors, including better diet and exercise, and   discouraging unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, is likely to improve cancer   survivors&rsquo; quality-of-life and may even prolong survival. Up to 85 percent of   cancer patients report interest in adopting healthy eating patterns, and   although little evidence links healthy eating with disease-free survival,   striving for and maintaining a healthy weight is likely to have a positive   effect on overall health. Exercise also should be promoted in cancer survivors;   many cancer patients do not exercise as much during treatment as they did before   diagnosis, and even after treatment is complete may fail to resume pretreatment   levels of activity. Oncologists can help promote exercise in cancer survivors;   studies show that patients are more likely to exercise when they are encouraged   to do so by their oncologists. Lastly, cancer survivors are at increased risk   for negative effects of smoking, which can cause serious health problems for   survivors because it worsens the function of already weakened hearts and lungs.   Programs have been developed to help cancer survivors quit smoking, and should   be an important part of survivor education and followup care.<br />
        <strong><br />
          <a name="3" id="3"></a>III. National Priorities in Cancer Survivorship</strong><br />
        With more   and more people surviving cancer, it becomes important to develop national   priorities designed to improve the overall experience and quality-of-life of   Americans living with, through, and surviving cancer. The President&rsquo;s Cancer   Panel 2003 Annual Report, <em>Living Beyond Cancer: Finding a New Balance</em>,   includes general recommendations to address the needs of cancer survivors across   the developmental lifecycle. Recommendations highlighted in the report include   patient access to records of care received and information concerning important   disease characteristics, followup care plans for each patient, counseling about   common physical and psychosocial after-effects of cancer and its treatment,   referrals to support groups and other supportive and educational services, and   creation of a nationwide electronic health records system by a consortium   established by the Department of Health and Human Services. The report also   identified issues of interest to specific age groups. </p>
      <p>Although survival rates for childhood cancers have increased over the past   decades, two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors suffer from at least one   delayed effect of cancer treatment, and one quarter of these are serious or   life-threatening. A recent report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), <em>Childhood Cancer Survivorship: Improving Care and Quality of Life</em>,   showed that these patients often are lost to or receive inadequate or   unsystematic followup care, and that access to followup care can be problematic   because insurance often does not adequately cover cancer survivors and their   special health and service needs. The IOM report contains detailed   recommendations to improve followup care and access to care for childhood cancer   survivors. </p>
      <p>Finally, cancer survivorship is increasingly seen as a public health issue.   With this in mind, a priority for the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control   at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is to develop greater   awareness among the general public, policymakers, researchers, advocates, and   survivors of the role public health can play in advancing cancer survivorship   issues.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>IV. Projecting the Burden of Cancer Survivorship:   Individual and Societal </strong><br />
        Cancer places a significant economic burden   on society, with the average cost of treatment for all cancer patients in the   United States reaching approximately $172 billion per year. This number does   not, however, take into account economic costs over the entire range of cancer   treatment, including the years of survivorship. Determining the true effects of   cancer on the labor market is difficult because individuals without cancer also   continually move in and out of the workforce. Measuring &ldquo;incidence costs,&rdquo; which   reflect the changing pattern of costs over the course of the disease, and &ldquo;time   costs,&rdquo; which reflect the value of patient time spent undergoing treatment   instead of engaging in other activities, will help to more accurately describe   the economic costs of cancer, particularly those associated with survivorship.   The increasing numbers of Americans aged 65 or older (expected to be 1 in 5 by   2030) also is likely to increase the economic burden of cancer. People in this   age group account for 57 percent of cancer cases and 71 percent of cancer   deaths. They also are more likely to suffer from other illnesses and health   problems alongside the cancer, and face special challenges to receiving care,   due to physical or psychological problems of their caregiver spouses as well as   limited finances, hampering their ability to receive assistance. <br />
