      As a breast cancer   advocate, my experience at the <em>Pathways to Health After Treatment: Cancer   Survivorship Conference</em> was both extremely informative and motivating.   Since my breast cancer diagnosis in 1995, my focus has been on education and   legislative advocacy for women, men, and their families affected by breast   cancer. The word &quot;survivorship&quot; was not particularly a part of my vocabulary, as   I do not easily embrace the term, feeling that it implies we have control over   our health after diagnosis; it ignores those that have died from the disease,   and one cannot survive a battle that has not been officially won, either   personally or as a disease type.
      <p>As a result of the conference, I more clearly understand the need for   continued research into the late effects of cancer treatment. I was surprised to   learn that extensive research was already underway. The National Cancer   Institute, the Centers for Disease Control, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, the   President&rsquo;s Cancer Report, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Cancer   Society all have engaged in meaningful dialogue and research and have issued   recommendations on the issues facing the 9.8 million cancer &quot;survivors&quot; in the   United States. By 2015, the challenge goal proposed by NCI is that no one will   suffer or die from cancer. If we are to achieve this goal, the recurring theme,   which captured my attention throughout the conference, pointed to two critical   national needs.</p>
      <p>First, quality healthcare for all is essential, but without <strong>access</strong> to care, we cannot even begin to create a future where   no one dies from cancer. In the President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel report, the <strong>first</strong> &ldquo;immediate action step listed (was to) &ldquo;<em>provide   immediate coverage for the uninsured</em> (84 percent of whom are workers and   their dependents) <em>upon a diagnosis of cancer to help ensure that no person   with this disease goes untreated.</em>&rdquo; In <em>Voices of a Broken Systemâ€”Real   People, Real Problems</em>, published by the President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel members,   Dr. Harold P. Freeman, Chair; Fran Visco, NBCC; Dr. Maureen O. Wilson; and Dr.   Dennis J. Slamon, UCLA; the moving and candid voices of cancer patients across   the country detail the many aspects in the failure of our health care delivery   system. </p>
      <p>Second, without information and research on the late effects of cancer   treatment, many patients WILL continue to <strong>suffer</strong>. After   treatment is completed what are one&rsquo;s reasonable lifetime risks of recurrent   disease or developing one or more chronic or late effects? <strong>Where</strong> are the standards for oncologists or primary care   physicians to guide their patients? Surveillance is desperately needed. Late   effects are not expressly explained to the patient, nor are the late effects   reported back so that perhaps treatment modifications could be made for future   patients and intervention research could be planned. <br />
        <br />
        Living with the   fear of recurrence is part of every &quot;survivor&rsquo;s&quot; journey. But access to   information is essential to reduce anxiety. Documents to be used for   surveillance discussion between a patient and doctor need to be developed and   distributed. A national program, possibly modeled after Canada&rsquo;s Passport to   Health program, compiling one&rsquo;s medical records into a portable form, would   ensure that all historical medical information is at hand, no matter where one   lives. </p>
      <p>One researcher at the conference proposed that late effects information would   possibly create &ldquo;cancer cripples&rdquo;. I contend that as <strong>informed</strong> patients and advocates, we would feel self-empowered, be more willing and   determined to adjust our lifestyle in areas of known prevention if given current   information and we would understand our &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; life-plan once our initial   treatment is completed. Our doctors need to be trained in &quot;survivor&quot; issues and   we need not sit on the sidelines and wait for something to happen. More   information needs to be centrally collected and published on post-treatment and   late effects in both psychosocial needs and physical impairment late effects,   employment, insurance and financial concerns. While an endpoint to cancer is   assumed by our family and friends, rarely does it conclude in the &quot;survivor&rsquo;s&quot;   mind. We experience a continuum of care, and we are not told that our risk of   late effects increases with time after treatment is completed. </p>
      <p>Dr. Julia Rowland, director of the Office of Cancer Survivorship, NCI, noted   that there were many areas of &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; between the IOM, CDC and President&rsquo;s   Cancer Panel reports on &quot;survivor&quot; issues and that NCI will be compiling a grid   of all issues, determining who is responsible for carrying out the program&rsquo;s   initiatives and who the partners will be. My hope is that in addition to the   research needed, immediate collection and dissemination of information to cancer   &lsquo;survivors&rsquo; will be a top priority.</p>
      <p>Many of our programs at the Virginia Breast Cancer Foundation and the Women&rsquo;s   Cancer Advocacy Network are focused on late effects of cancer. My goal is to be   involved in planning a physician&rsquo;s conference on this topic in Virginia to raise   awareness for oncologists, primary care physicians and patients on the need for   open communication with the patient population and the reporting of late-term   effects of cancer treatment. The surprise of late effects of cancer treatment   need not be another step in a cancer &quot;survivor&rsquo;s&quot; journey.</p>
