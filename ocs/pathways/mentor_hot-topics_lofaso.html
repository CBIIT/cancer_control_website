                          Three years ago my   life changed forever. I joined the ranks of the almost 10 million cancer   survivors. However, what I thought was going to be the end of a life threatening   illness, with treatments finally behind me, turned out to be the beginning of a   new and contentious relationship with my body.
                          <p>Following my surgery for an ovarian germ cell tumor, I was treated with four   cycles of Cisplatin, Etoposide, and Bleomycin. I have since learned that side   effects from chemotherapy treatments such as these can range from mild to life   threatening, and research indicates that the risk for any of these effects   increases with time after treatment. I was chagrined to learn that Cisplatin is   detectable in the body as late as 20 years after treatment. I have yet to learn   of the number of years the other two chemicals will be floating around inside of   my body; however, it is clear from studies that individuals who have been   treated with Etoposide are at high risk for secondary primary cancers such as   leukemia. Bleomycin poses its own risks of fibrosis of the lung. </p>
                          <p>Much of our understanding of the late effects of treatments comes from   studies of childhood cancer survivors, a population whose numbers have been   rapidly increasing with the evolution of more effective treatments. The three   most common treatment related causes of death that have been reported in   childhood cancer survivors are 1) the development of a secondary or subsequent   cancer, 2) cardiac toxicity, and 3) pulmonary complications. Of great concern is   the fact that death rates due to subsequent cancers and other causes increase   more rapidly 15 to 25 years after diagnosis (Childhood Cancer Survivorship pgs   50-51). </p>
                          <p>Since my treatments have ended, I have experienced a number of physical   problems that I now understand may be only the tip of the iceberg from the   damage of the toxins that were administered into my system. </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Fatigue–I am not alone with my exhaustion. Research has indicted that almost   60 percent of survivors report difficulties with fatigue, which impacts every   aspect of our lives. </li>
                            <li>Risk of Cardiac Problems–Individuals treated with high dose chemotherapy are   at high risk for long term cardiovascular problems. A cholesterol test has   confirmed that I am indeed included in this high risk group as my cholesterol   levels are far above normal (a residual effect of the Cisplatin). I was   fortunate to discover this in a timely fashion: during a routine eye exam my   optician warned me of some white spots on the back of my eyes that were   indicative of high cholesterol and encouraged me to immediately have it checked.   Being only 38, of average weight and engaged in regular exercise, it never would   have occurred to me that this might be a problem. Now, I am facing the fact that   I am at high risk for heart disease and stroke. </li>
                            <li>Osteoporosi–I began hormone replacement therapy the day after my   hysterectomy. After suffering from some extreme hip pain, two years following my   treatments, I discovered that I was already suffering from borderline   osteoporosis. It was only after numerous tests, including several bone biopsies   that doctors even thought to have my bone density checked. Is this a side effect   of the chemotherapy, or simply a failure of my body to synthesize the hormone   properly? Nobody seems to know. </li>
                          </ol>
                          <p>What is perhaps the most frustrating about my concerns is that not one of the   specialists, nor my primary care physician, had ever indicated that I was at   high risk for any of these health problems. Strange, you may think, but when you   take into account the status of cancer care it is quite understandable that many   health care providers, even oncologists, are not focused on long term effects of   treatments or are unaware of the need for long term follow up of their patients   beyond the annual check for tumor markers or some other indicator of recurrence.   It is only recently that doctors have even had the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; of looking at so   many survivors. Twenty years ago, with a cancer diagnosis so often being fatal,   the long term effects of the treatments were simply not a focus. Doctors were   just trying to keep us alive. Today, however, with almost 10 million survivors,   and more expected in the future, it is imperative that the need for lifelong   follow up care is communicated to all health care practitioners and becomes the   standard of care for cancer survivors.</p>
                          <p>As to my future, clearly there are many unanswered questions. I do know that   information and communication is what will keep me and others like me as healthy   as possible. In order to help make this happen, I have become an advocate and   educator in my community, distributing information, doing presentations and   working to raise awareness. I strive to be informed and involve myself in   opportunities to provide information and support, both for the sake of my   health, and for the sake of any other individual dealing with this disease and   the after effects of the treatments. Information will always be my best self   defense as I continue through life as a cancer survivor. <br />
