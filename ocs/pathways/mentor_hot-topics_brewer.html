      <p><strong>&ldquo;The Importance of Exercise and Diet for Cancer Survivors &rdquo; a   personal reflection by Chris Brewer</strong></p>

      <p>There is an increasing focus on not just the treatment aspect of the cancer   experience, but also on the issues of cancer survivorship: those things in and   around the cancer patient&rsquo;s life that are as important to the individual as the   actual care received. One of the key aspects of this new focus is how we can   best intervene in some situations, particularly in the areas of physical fitness   and dietary change. Not too ironically, these are key issues in modern American   society and not mutually exclusive to the cancer realm.</p>

      The conventional   wisdom had been in the past that rest, rest and more rest were the keys to   successful treatment. Granted, active treatments such as surgical procedures,   radiation therapy, and chemotherapy often leave the cancer survivor in an   exhausted state, but the residual effects of these procedures are relatively   short-lived. When video was shown of five-time Tour de France cyclist Lance   Armstrong riding his bike on a trainer in a hospital room people around the   world were amazed that this was possible. But the reality is that physical   activity has many positive effects for the cancer survivor on several different   planes.
      <p>I recalled my own experience along these lines while Dr. Kerry Courneya,   Ph.D, was presenting his report on &quot;Promoting Behavior Change After Cancer&quot; at   the 2004 Cancer Survivorship Conference. I had been diagnosed with advanced   testicular cancer in October 1996, just 2 weeks from Lance&rsquo;s fateful day.   Following two successful surgical procedures and two rounds of chemotherapy, I   was, to be blunt, wasted from my treatments. Cancer-free, yes, but as a lifelong   amateur athlete, I knew I was in terrible shape and emotionally distraught, as   well.</p>
      <p>My oncologist and urologist encouraged me to walk as much as I could, even   starting my &ldquo;training&rdquo; while relatively bedridden following major abdominal   surgery. Laps around the nurse&rsquo;s station were often rewarded with a hit from the   morphine pump to quell the pain, all the while assured by my medical team that   in the long run this would be for the better. They explained that not only was   it good to get my blood flowing and joints moving, but the tangible benefit of   seeing my strength and stamina improve by being able to do more on a daily basis   would boost my emotional well-being, too. </p>
      <p>As I progressed from walking around a hospital wing with a cane to around the   block at home, unassisted, I did indeed feel my energy returning as well as the   hope of successful reintegration into normal society. And as this energy   returned, it encouraged me to go on even further and I then started cycling to   further improve my aerobic capacity. This life-changing experience led to   further involvement with the Lance Armstrong Foundation and a newfound passion   for the sport of cycling.</p>
      <p>Not that everyone who starts exercising will go on to become a competitive   athlete, but its clear that the benefits far outweigh the initial physical   challenges. It is therefore the role of the medical team to figure out the best   manner to prepare the patient for the tasks at hand, and time for the patient to   get ready to get out of bed and get moving. &quot;When someone goes in for   chemotherapy, the first thing on their mind is not exerciseâ€”it's going home and   taking it easy,&quot; Dr. Courneya said. &quot;Most oncologists do not recommend exercise   to cancer patients either, and one purpose of these (new) guidelines is to let   oncologists and other health care providers know that we should be recommending   exercise to cancer survivors both during and after treatments.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Amen to that.</p>
      <p><strong>The Need for Dietary Change</strong></p>
      <p>As a society it is safe to say that we are obsessed with what we eat. Diet   fads fade in and out like the wind, and someone with cancer is not immune to   these trends but is in real need for solid advice. Wendy Demark-Wahnefried,   Ph.D. from Duke University addressed many of these concerns at the Survivorship   Conference. Unlike increased exercise, which may initially sound contrary to   successful treatment, most of us know that what we consume has a direct   relationship to how we feel and our ability to function. Anyone whose diet has   consisted of fast-food and excess sweets / snacks will not be at the top of   their game. But so many Americans have poor eating habits that they simply do   not know what to eat to encourage effective healing and a better lifestyle after   cancer. However, nutritional counseling has not really been the realm of the   oncologist and so it has often been left to the patient to muddle through what   may or may not be in their best interest.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Oncology researchers know that carrying around too many extra pounds can   increase cancer risk in the first place. Now, they&rsquo;re beginning to collect   evidence that excess weight may potentially hurt the chances of survival after   some cancers. In the case of breast cancer, for which there&rsquo;s the most data,   there have been numerous studies that have linked being overweight at the time   of diagnosis with recurrent disease, decreased survival, or both,&rdquo; Dr.   Demark-Wahnefried noted.</p>
      <p>The challenge here is that dietary moods of America are almost always in a   state of flux as new knowledge is garnered and urban myths are fought. Here   again, though, the cancer community can take a lesson from the athletic world   that is not looking for a quick-fix but rather a long-term approach to dietary   needs. Cancer survivors, like athletes, need to fuel their bodies efficiently   and effectively to allow them the best chance to heal and to combat future   cancers as well. Dr. Demarkl-Wahnefried recommends a high-fiber, low-fat diet   and regular exercise. While this may sound like common-sense advice, in these   days of high-carb, high-protein, Caveman, and other diet fads, it&rsquo;s clear that   common sense is not that common, and again it falls on the partnership of the   medical team and the patient to find what works best in their situation.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
      <p>As an athlete it is good to know that the approach I took in my cancer   survivorship was apparently the correct one. Exercise as best you can, eat   right, and follow your medical team&rsquo;s advice. The challenge here is that   according to these two researchers, I was in the minority and essentially got   lucky in my approach. It is therefore incumbent upon us to spread the word that   these concepts are important to all cancer survivors and not just a select few,   and in the process we&rsquo;ll improve their quality of life and potentially reduce   medical costs and the risk of future cancers. All that from some things we&rsquo;ve   suspected beneficial for a long time now.<br />
