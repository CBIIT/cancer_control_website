      <p><strong>&ldquo;Building a Bridge to Cancer Survivors&rdquo; a personal reflection by   Marion Burch Cimbala</strong></p>
      <p>President/Owner, Body Therapy Center<br />
        <a href="http://www.bodytherapyaustin.com">www.bodytherapyaustin.com</a></p>
      <p>As a very recent cancer survivor, not professionally involved as a cancer   advocate, attending the Cancer Survivorship Pathways to Health After Treatment   conference was truly an eye-opening experience. It was not my first exposure to   many of the issues a cancer survivor faces—I was already living with many of the   issues—but it was the first time I realized the scope of knowledge about these   issues, and how very much can, and should, be done to optimize life after   cancer. </p>
      <p>Understanding cancer as a chronic disease is a good first step in   understanding what life is like once you have heard the words &ldquo;you have cancer.&rdquo;   Even though I have known many people who have had cancer, I was largely unaware   of the short and long-term physical, financial, and psychological effects of the   diagnosis. Perhaps it is because we, individually and as a society, tend to   focus on beating cancer, and then (for those that are lucky enough to do so)   returning to our lives. Friends, family, and health care workers are sources of   encouragement in this process. It is common to hear, &ldquo;you can beat this&rdquo; or   &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this.&rdquo; Those of us lucky enough to be told, &ldquo;You   don&rsquo;t have any evidence of cancer anymore, we think we have gotten all the   cancer, and we don&rsquo;t think it will come back&rdquo; are expected to move smoothly back   into life, grateful that we don&rsquo;t have cancer anymore, and being told how lucky   we are. </p>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="250" bgcolor="#666666" align="right">

          <tr>
            <td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>The views and opinions expressed do not necessarily   state or reflect those of the United States Government and they may not be used   for advertising or product endorsement purposes. </td>

      For many reasons,   returning to our lives can be more of a challenge than fighting the disease.   What is necessary is a strategy that will include ways to address moving on with   life, managing the physical, financial, and emotional effects of the cancer, and   continuing to heal.
      <p>The Pathways to Health conference provided exposure to in depth research and   programming directed at improving quality of life for cancer survivors. We also   reviewed the 2003-2004 Annual Report from the Presidents Cancer Panel, entitled   Living Beyond Cancer: Finding a New Balance. This report was of particular   interest because the information and recommendations encourage appropriate   intervention from the medical community during and after treatment, which have   the potential to positively impact the lives of every cancer survivor. </p>
      <p>I believe the challenge before us is making access to the knowledge and   recommendations in this report a reality for all cancer patients. Despite the   fact that I received excellent medical care from my physicians, none of the   recommendations in the Presidents Cancer Panel report were a part of my   experience during or after treatment. My experience has been shared by others. I   have attempted to follow up with the medical offices regarding several of the   issues. It has been challenging, and mostly unsuccessful. As a businessperson,   it seems logical that unless there are incentives in place to provide the   recommended interventions to cancer patients, there is little hope of success in   a medical system that is already challenged. If practical considerations prevent   delivery of survivorship interventions through the traditional health care   system, then perhaps consideration should be given to other innovative options   for delivery of these interventions, such as the use of public health campaigns,   or the Internet.</p>
      <p>It is my intention to continue learning about and develop strategies for   practical application of these programs of Living Beyond Cancer, so that we can   ensure these recommendations can be provided to every cancer patient. Regardless   of the how good the research, information, and programs are, and no matter how   recommended survivorship interventions can improve the quality of our lives,   unless cancer survivors hear the information, we have failed.<br />
