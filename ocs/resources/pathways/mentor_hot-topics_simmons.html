                  <h1>Late Effects After Cancer</h1>
                  <h2 class="bi2004">“Late Psychological Effects of Cancer &amp; Its Treatment” a personal reflection by Jennifer Edens Simmons</h2>
		<p>Advocate</p>
		<p>Ask anyone what the   three strongest words in the English language are, and the immediate response   will probably be accompanied by a somewhat embarrassed smile: &ldquo;&lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; of   course!&rdquo; While certainly a potent declaration that humans almost universally   invite, an equally potent three-word phrase that all too many of us have   heard—or will hear at some point in our lives—is, &quot;You have cancer.&quot; Like most   people, I never imagined I would hear that brief sentence myself, so I was   stunned beyond belief when it was delivered to me 2 years ago, when I was 36, on   a cold examination table. My immediate thought? &quot;I&rsquo;m going to die.&quot;</p>
      <p>Like so many of us, as I was growing up in the seventies, the very word   &quot;cancer&quot; was essentially synonymous with death itself. But because of the   tremendous advances in treatments developed for cancer since that era (there are   approximately one hundred types), close to 10 million cancer survivors are alive   in the United States today. Two out of three adults will survive their   malignancies. Paradoxically, however, medical treatments that allow patients to   conquer these diseases physically often fail to adequately address the unique   psychosocial needs of this growing number of survivors.</p>
      <p>Many assume that once cancer therapy is over, the treated individual can   relax and effortlessly return to his or her former life as it was before   diagnosis. However, this is often a highly stressful, sometimes terrifying   period for many. As Elizabeth McKinley, a physician and cancer survivor, recalls   her own feelings when her treatments ended, &quot;Instead of joyous, I felt lonely,   abandoned, and terrified... We (survivors) just move from the quantifiable,   treatable disease to the immeasurable uncertainty of survivorship. Believe me,   the former is easier to deal with sometimes.&quot;1</p>
      <p>As a cancer survivor myself, I was thrilled to be able to participate in a   recent conference addressing multiple issues surrounding survivorship. Organized   by the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute and supported   by the Lance Armstrong Foundation, this program highlighted the critical work   being conducted by numerous researchers and physicians across the country. It   confirmed that survivorship science is a burgeoning, crucial area of medicine   and psychology developing rapidly in response to the growing numbers of   individuals whose lives are touched by cancer, many of whom move beyond it.</p>
      <p>Among multiple topics covered at the conference, I chose to focus on the late   psychological effects of cancer and its treatment. This was a particularly   poignant subject for me personally because, like Elizabeth McKinley, I often   felt overwhelmed by the emotional burden of a possible recurrence. I struggled   with how to most effectively deal with the anxiety associated with having gone   through an unexpected life-threatening illness, particularly at a young age. I   wanted to know what specific suggestions were proposed by researchers studying   cancer survivors. For instance, was there anything I could do to alleviate my   often intractable angst?</p>
      <p>I was especially interested in the presentations of two researchers, Dr.   Annette Stanton of UCLA and Dr. Frank J. Penedo of the University of Miami. Each   addressed the particular psychological needs of those who had undergone cancer   therapy, and examined the efficacy of several post-treatment psychosocial   interventions in allaying emotional distress. I was curious about their findings   not only because they held the promise of offering coping techniques for cancer   patients in general, but also because they contrasted the unique needs of both   men and women who face gender-specific malignancies. Dr. Stanton&rsquo;s research   emphasis was on breast cancer survivors, while Dr. Penedo concentrated on men   who had been treated for prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of her presentation, Dr. Stanton introduced a term which I   had never heard before: the &quot;re-entry phase.&quot;2 She defined this as   approximately the year following completion of primary treatments. It is   commonly thought that people are relieved upon learning that something they have   experienced actually has a name; it certainly made me feel good to know that the   difficult year I had weathered following my chemotherapy had an official label   within the medical community! </p>
      <p>Dr. Stanton described two studies she had conducted, only one of which I will   cover in this paper. Her clear goal in both cases was to identify those   strategies which most effectively helped women previously treated for   early-stage breast cancer combat anxiety related to their disease, as well as to   their lives after treatment cessation. Her studies were motivated by the fact   that re-entry transition for women with histories of breast cancer is   understudied despite a large population of survivors (over two million), and by   the widespread problems of recurrence fears, lack of social support, and   lingering post-treatment symptoms.</p>
      <p>In one study, Dr. Stanton evaluated 60 women within 20 weeks of treatment   cessation. The women were asked to write about one of three randomly assigned   topics in four 20-minute sessions over a period of several weeks. After 3   months, she assessed their physical complaints, the number of times they had   made medical appointments for physical symptoms, and their general levels of   psychological distress. Noteworthy conclusions of this study were that women who   wrote about their deepest thoughts and feelings reported the fewest physical   symptoms and doctor visits among participants; that those who had begun the   study in greatest denial of their illness derived the most obvious benefits from   writing about positive aspects of their cancer experiences; and that patients   who had initially exhibited low levels of denial benefited most from writing   about their deepest thoughts and feelings. Clearly, there was notable distress   reduction for many women who shared highly specific aspects of their cancer   experiences on paper.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Dr. Penedo&rsquo;s study was conducted in a group setting.3   Most of his 255 participants were at least 9 months post-treatment, and the   majority had localized disease. Because approximately 50 percent of men with a   history of treatment for prostate cancer have problems with sexual functioning   and many have urinary problems, too, there are numerous physical as well as   emotional challenges faced by this group.</p>
      <p>Over a period of 10 weeks, Dr. Penedo&rsquo;s participants attended 2-hour sessions   once a week, during which a wide range of relaxation and stress management   topics were discussed. As a result, many reported increases in urinary function   and improvement of negative moods. Those who benefited most from these sessions,   physically and psychologically, were men whose anxiety levels had been highest   at the beginning of the study. Dr. Penedo&rsquo;s research focused on the power of   group-based interventions and their role in stress reduction, and participants   emerged from his sessions with less anxiety and depression in addition to   improved coping skills. Overall, their quality of life had significantly   improved as a result of participation in his study.</p>
      <p>Although Drs. Stanton and Penedo studied populations with remarkably   different sets of problems related to their specific cancer types, the common   thread between them unifies survivors of all cancers, as well as those who have   faced any life-changing illnesses. Anxiety and depression are difficult, if not   impossible, to avoid altogether when one is faced with such a formidable   challenge, but we are beginning to understand how to mitigate the negative   consequences of serious illnesses. Ever-expanding research gives us the tools we   need in order to develop coping mechanisms. Whether it be journaling, attending   support groups, or involving oneself in charitable organizations, opportunities   for positively managing the late effects of what used to be an almost   universally devastating disease abound. Elizabeth McKinley stresses the   therapeutic benefits of support groups as well as writing in her account of   coping with survivorship: &quot;Probably the most important tool for me has been a   support group of extraordinary women with whom I can share all my fears and   successes…finally, writing about what I was feeling throughout my cancer process   has allowed me the freedom to express myself and a safe place to kick and scream   and call it all unfair.&quot; 1</p>
      <p>Choosing an expressive way to counteract the often negative psychological   aftereffects of cancer and its treatment enables survivors to channel their   energies in hopeful directions. As Jerome Groopman, a physician who has studied   the spiritual lives of patients with serious illnesses for years, eloquently   sums it up: &quot;Clear-eyed hope gives us the courage to confront our circumstances   and the capacity to surmount them.&quot; 4</p>
