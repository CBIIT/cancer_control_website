                  <h2 class="bi2004">“Issues Concerning Employment &amp; Insurance” a personal reflection by Mary Zapor</h2>
		<p>Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, ACOR</p>
		<p>As of January 1,   2001, there were approximately 9.8 million cancer survivors in the United   States, representing approximately 3.5 percent of the population. The elderly   population is statistically more likely to be diagnosed with cancer, and the   American population is aging at unprecedented rates. Therefore, Americans can   expect an increasing number of cancer diagnoses to be made in the future, but   also an increasing number of cancer survivors.</p>
      <p>Research efforts during the past 30 years have given the American medical   community many more tools to combat cancer more successfully. This has resulted   in a tripling of the number of cancer survivors from 1971 to 1999. However,   aggressive treatments such as cytotoxic agents, radiation, and other drugs or   types of treatment are the mainstay in fighting many types of cancer. Although   these treatments may rid the patient's body of cancer cells, they may also exact   a large toll. Often the patient continues to feel exhaustion, pain, or suffer   other effects of treatment long after their active treatment ends. The treatment   may cause &quot;late effects,&quot; such as other cancers, to occur in the future,   sometimes decades after the initial treatment ceases. Thus, a patient may face   even more treatment and more stresses long after their first battle with cancer   is over. </p>
      <p>In today&rsquo;s economy, most Americans have obtained health insurance through   their employers. As survivors of childhood cancers age and are no longer   eligible for coverage under their parents' policies, they may not be able to   obtain health insurance on their own. Even though childhood survivors have the   right to continue their parents' health coverage for a while under COBRA, if   they can afford the premiums, at some point they may be subject to pre-existing   condition exclusions in their own health coverage. </p>
      <p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) has   helped ensure that pre-existing conditions may not be excluded in certain new   health policies if the gaps in coverage are relatively short. However, childhood   survivors may at some point have to choose between going to graduate school   full-time and getting a full-time job in order to have health insurance without   pre-existing condition exclusions. Some states have also helped bridge this gap   by passing laws that prevent the exclusion of pre-existing conditions in certain   employment-related health insurance plans. Even so, cancer survivors may not be   able to buy life or health insurance, and the financial security of the cancer   survivor and his or her family can be greatly impacted as a result. </p>
      <p>Adults face many of the same problems as childhood survivors, except there   may be additional economic pressures. Even if doctors are able to successfully   combat an adult's cancer, they may not be able to do so within the time period   permitted by an employer's leave policy. The federal Family and Medical Leave   Act provides additional relief in many instances by giving certain employees the   right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for a serious medical condition,   such as cancer. If the employee cannot return to work at the end of that time,   however, they can lose their job simply because they needed treatment or   additional time to recover. The problem can be compounded further if the cancer   patient needs help during their treatment, and other family members must also   stay home from work to provide assistance or support. </p>
      <p>If the primary or sole breadwinner is stricken by cancer, the entire family   suffers the economic effects. Without a steady income, the family's financial   resources can be inadequate to pay for the necessities of daily living, let   alone medicines and expensive treatments. A prolonged illness, treatment, or   recovery period can result in the loss of not only income, but also the family's   health insurance coverage and any life and disability insurance benefits   provided by the patient&rsquo;s former employer. If the family does not have income or   insurance benefits, they may not be able to obtain even the most basic or   follow-up care that is needed to diagnose, treat, cure, and monitor their   conditions. It should be no surprise that one-half of all of the bankruptcies   filed in this country are a result of a medical diagnosis. </p>
      <p>Some cancer survivors may never be able to return to work, or may not be able   to perform work at the same level of skills as they did previously. Treatment   may have interfered with their cognitive, cardiovascular, and pulmonary   function. A survivor may be more tired or experience more problems with recall.   They may be less able to multi-task, learn new functions, comprehend material,   make decisions, or work with numbers. In addition to other side effects of   treatment, they may experience pain, or may be less mobile or less able to   communicate clearly. </p>
      <p>Employers may be less understanding of a cancer survivor's performance   because of the misconception that a cancer patient is &quot;cured&quot; after treatment.   Once treatment stops, an employer's sympathy may be replaced by a renewed   expectation that the employee/survivor should be able to return to full   performance. Although an employer has a right to require that its employees be   able to perform the essential functions of their positions, every employer needs   to be aware that the side effects of the treatment may permanently alter the   patient's ability to work as productively as they did previously. Therefore   breaks or other accommodations may be reasonably required for the employee who   is also a cancer survivor. </p>
      <p>There is no question that there is an impact on the economy of this country   because of cancer. However, the costs of cancer survivorship are not as obvious.   Not only are healthcare prescription drug and insurance costs themselves a   factor, but there are the hidden costs of having employees missing time from   work to go to follow-up evaluations or to provide assistance to other family   members. Additional economic costs are incurred if the side effects of treatment   prevent employees from working full-time or even part-time. There are also the   often- unexpected costs associated with late effects. In an environment where   health insurance is supplied most often through employment but cancer survivors   may not be able to return to work, it is imperative that we find a way for   cancer survivors to have access to adequate and affordable care to monitor their   conditions after their treatment. <br />
