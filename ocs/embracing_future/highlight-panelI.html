   	    <p><h2>Cancer Survivorship: Embracing the Future:<br />
   	      <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#09F">Conference Highlights</span></h2></p>
        <p><strong>PLENARY SESSION: <a href="plenary-comm-ehealth.html">Communications and eHealth</a></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Cancer Survivor Panel Discussion</strong><br />
          <em>Virgil   Simmons<br />
            Founder and President, The Prostate Net<br />
            Secaucus, NJ</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Significant unmet needs for education and empowerment concerning cancer   information exist, especially in minority communities. The Internet represents   an important resource to connect people quickly with information that can save   or improve the quality of their lives.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><em>Theprostatenet.com</em> Web site seeks to connect African-American males   with information on prostate cancer including screening and available resources,   through use of its Web site, printed materials, and peer counseling programs   featuring prostate cancer survivors. In another effort to reach this population,   The Prostate Net has recruited and trained barbers as &quot;lay health motivators&quot; to   promote awareness of prostate cancer risk and screening and to connect people to   their local medical communities. Similar approaches, such as involving women in   churches, are in use to promote awareness of health risks of particular interest   to the African-American community, such as high blood pressure, diabetes,   stroke, and breast and lung cancers.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>The &quot;In the Know Newsletter&quot; was created to provide further information   about health conditions of interest to African Americans. &quot;In the Know&quot; awards   are given for excellence in addressing health disparities. Podcasts and   &quot;cellcasts&quot; are other methods being explored to bring health information to this   community.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>The &quot;Wired Barbershop&quot; program places computers with Web access in   barbershops to enhance access to and delivery of knowledge. Educational videos   concerning prostate cancer also have been provided to barbershops, along with   printed information to share with doctors or family members. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Susan Lowell Butler<br />
          Executive Director<br />
          D.C. Cancer   Consortium<br />
          Washington, DC</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Concerns of a cancer survivor (Ms. Butler is an 11-year survivor of breast   and ovarian cancers):
            <ul>
              <li>Health insurers are developing online tools for consumer use, but concerns   exist related to whether the information gathered from these tools will be used   to the benefit or detriment of consumers, particularly cancer survivors. </li>
              <li>Many patients have difficulties accessing their own medical information.   Reliable and easy-to-use tools are needed to allow patients to manage their   medical records. Related to this, tools are needed to allow easy and seamless   access to patients' medical records by all of their health care providers. These   tools need to go beyond the Passport program and provide information to all   patient caretakers </li>
              <li>Disparities in access are significant; in particular, the elderly, sick, and   poor suffer from a lack of access to information and resources. </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>Concerns of a patient advocate:
            <ul>
              <li>Online resources are important and may help decrease disparities by   effectively disseminating information about beneficial health care tools and   resources. Developers of these tools should work with advocates to ensure that   the tools are effective and to develop relationships with online communities,   which will influence policy and the distribution of research dollars. </li>
              <li>Inexpensive access to health care journals also is highly desirable, as are   simple, easy-to-use consumer healthdcare Web sites. </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>Concerns of a health care executive:
            <ul>
              <li>As the Director of the Washington, DC Cancer Consortium, Ms. Butler created   a Web site to serve the complex DC community of patients, caregivers, and   researchers. The Consortium encompasses 52 different groups, including four   cancer centers and hospitals as well as neighborhood health organizations, all   of which are working to implement the DC Comprehensive Cancer Plan. These   activities have underscored the need for greater community access to the   Internet, perhaps by making computers available to all public school students   and in public sites (retail stores). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Gilles Frydman<br />
          Founder and President, Association of Cancer Online   Resources<br />
          New York, NY</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Association of Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) was created to help cancer   patients find care specialists and online communities of patients diagnosed with   the same cancer. This resource is especially useful and important for people   diagnosed with rare cancers who may have trouble finding specialists, or fellow   patients, in their communities. ACOR also can provide support and resources for   patients who are just finishing treatment.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>The Passport for Care promises to be a useful resource, but more input from   patients and caregivers is needed during its development. Patients will be able   to provide suggestions for presenting information in a way that is useful and   understandable to the patients themselves. The power of online patient   communities should not be underestimated—for example, the success of Gleevac can   be attributed in part to the efforts of ACOR in quickly recruiting trial   participants. </li>
