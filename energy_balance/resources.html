			<h2>Energy Balance Research at the National Cancer Institute</h2>
				<h3>Research Resources</h3>
                <p>Obesity is the result of a complex interplay of many  factors including genes, metabolism, behavior, environment, and policy.  Effective strategies for preventing and treating obesity must, therefore,  encompass a broad program of research topics and disciplines. They also must  use new and innovative approaches that foster the ability of investigators to  conduct this important research. NCI strives to facilitate and accelerate  progress in obesity research to improve public health.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact sheet:  Obesity and Cancer Risk</strong><br />
                  <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/obesity">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/obesity</a><br />
                  This fact sheet  discusses definitions and measurement of obesity as well as its prevalence and  its epidemiologic relationship to particular cancer types. The fact sheet also  summarizes NCI-funded initiatives and resources that have a focus on obesity.</p>
                <p><strong>Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)</strong><br />
                  <a href="http://hints.cancer.gov/">http://hints.cancer.gov/</a> <br />
                  HINTS collects nationally representative data about how  American adults access and use health information, how they use information  technology to manage health and health information, and the degree to which  they are engaged in healthy behaviors. HINTS has included energy balance survey  items in 2003, 2005, 2007 and the current iteration of HINTS (being fielded  2011-2014). Specifically, HINTS includes survey items that allow researchers to  explore questions related to nutrition, physical activity, weight and body mass  index (BMI). </p>

                  In 2008, the Federal Government issued its first-ever  Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. They describe the types and amounts  of physical activity that offer substantial health benefits to Americans.  Accompanying the guidelines is an Advisory Committee Report that reviewed  existing scientific literature to identify evidence to develop the physical  activity recommendations. This website presents the Research Recommendations  from the Advisory Committee Report. For each topic area, relevant NCI and NIH  funding opportunities are highlighted for researchers who wish to explore these  remaining gaps in the scientific evidence. Also listed are links to information  about surveys, databases, and other NCI and NIH research resources that could  help answer specific research questions under several of the topic areas. Also  available on the website is a link to the Physical Activity Guidelines for  Americans Midcourse Report, which was released in 2013.</p>
