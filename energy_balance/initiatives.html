            <h2>Energy Balance Research at the National Cancer Institute</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Research Initiatives</strong><br />
              Obesity is the result of a complex interplay of many factors including genes,  metabolism, behavior, environment, and policy. Effective strategies for  preventing and treating obesity must, therefore, encompass a broad program of  research topics and disciplines. They also must use new and innovative  approaches that foster the ability of investigators to conduct this important  research. NCI strives to facilitate and accelerate progress in obesity research  to improve public health.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Transdisciplinary Research on Energetics and Cancer (TREC) Centers</strong><br />
  <a href="/brp/trec/index.html">http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/trec/index.html</a><br />
              The TREC initiative is studying obesity and cancer because existing  research tells us that many cancers are linked with obesity. Scientists in the  TREC initiative are conducting research to learn how the combined effects of  obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity increase cancer risk.  They are also searching for effective ways to prevent obesity.</p>
            <hr width="75%" align="center" noshade />
            <p><strong>National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research (NCCOR)</strong><br />
              <a href="http://www.nccor.org">http://www.nccor.org</a> <a href="../exit_disclaimer.html"><img src="../images/Icon_External_Link.png" alt="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0" /></a><br />
              NCCOR brings together the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  the National Institutes of Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the  US Department of Agriculture to address the problem of childhood obesity in  America. NCCOR's mission is to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and  application of childhood obesity research and to halt—and reverse—the current  childhood obesity trend through enhanced coordination. Childhood obesity  requires concerted efforts to increase both healthy eating and physical  activity in order to alter children&rsquo;s daily energy balance. NCCOR is focusing  on efforts that have the potential to benefit children, teens and their  families, and the communities in which they live. A special emphasis is placed  on the populations and communities in which obesity rates are highest and  rising the fastest: African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans,  Asian/Pacific Islanders, and children living in low-income communities.</p>
            <p>NCI has been an active and central participant in NCCOR. Staff in NCI's  Applied Research Program (ARP), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences  are participating in NCCOR priority projects and have led several of them.</p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li>Development of a       web-based (front-engine) registry of valid and reliable measures to assess       independent, dependent and key moderating variables in childhood obesity       prevention research. This tool is available at <a href="http://www.nccor.org/projects/measures/index.php">http://www.nccor.org/projects/measures/index.php</a>. </li>
              <li>Development of an       online catalogue of surveillance systems relevant to childhood obesity       research, spanning the social ecological spectrum. The purpose of the       catalogue is to raise researchers' awareness and use of existing       surveillance systems relevant to childhood obesity. This tool is available       at <a href="http://nccor.org/projects/catalogue/index.php">http://nccor.org/projects/catalogue/index.php</a>. </li>
              <li>A conference series       planning initiative. ARP staff led the organization of a <a href="http://nccor.org/resources/nccor/webinars.php#fourpart">webinar       series</a> on obesity policy evaluation effectiveness held in 2009.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A portolio of  innovative <a href="http://nccor.org/projects/greenhealth/index.php">&ldquo;green  health&rdquo;</a> activities  has resulted from NCCOR&rsquo;s collaboration with the sustainability-focused green  design and building industries. Environmental design can influence children&rsquo;s  social norms and behaviors related to dietary choices and daily physical  activity.<br />
              <br />
              Rachel Ballard-Barbash, MD, MPH, Associate Director of NCI&rsquo;s Applied  Research Program (ARP), is the NIH representative to the NCCOR Steering  Committee.</p>

            <p><strong>National Fruit &amp; Vegetable Program - Fruits and Veggies &ndash; More  Matters&trade; Initiative </strong><br />
              <a href="/brp/hbrb/dietary_behaviors.html">http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/hbrb/dietary_behaviors.html</a><br />
        In 2007, the 5 A Day For Better Health Program became the National  Fruit and Vegetable Program and launched the Fruits &amp; Veggies &ndash; More  Matters&trade; initiative, a public-private partnership that is working  collaboratively and synergistically to increase the consumption of fruits and  vegetables for improved public health. Fruits &amp; Veggies &ndash; More Matters&trade; is  a dynamic health initiative that consumers will see in stores, online, at home  and on packaging. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the  Produce for Better Health Foundation are leading this initiative.</p>
            <hr width="75%" align="center" noshade />
            <p><strong>Obesity Policy Research</strong><br />
              <a href="http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/areas/obesity/">http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/areas/obesity/</a><br />
              The NCI Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch (RFMMB) supports  various initiatives in obesity policy research. For example, RFMMB promotes  research on diet and physical activity that may inform policymaking at local,  state, or federal levels. A workshop was held in June, 2007 on considerations  for an obesity policy research agenda. In 2012, a workshop was held for the  principal investigators of active grants in this research arena to increase  productivity and promote cross-fertilization among the grantees by identifying  common issues, challenges, themes and opportunities for collaboration. RFMMB  also supports initiatives pertaining to measurement of the food and physical  activity environments. A workshop was held in November, 2007 to assess the  state of the science of these environmental measures, examine knowledge gained  from research using measurement instruments and methodologies, and define gaps  and priorities for future work. Additional information about these initiatives,  and related resources, are available on the website.</p>

            <p><strong>Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI)</strong><br />
              <a href="http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/diet/gei">http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/diet/gei</a><br />
              The GEI is a NIH-wide project led by the National Institute of  Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the National Human Genome Research  Institute (NHGRI). The overarching goal of the GEI is to determine the etiology  of common diseases by focusing on the interaction of genetic and environmental  factors to better understand how these interactions contribute to health and  disease. The genetic component is focused on genome-wide association studies  and data analytic methods, while the other component examines exposure biology.  The Exposure Biology Program of the GEI supports the development of improved  measures and more objective methods to assess dietary intake and physical  activity.</p>

            <p><strong>Health, Eating, Activity, and  Lifestyle (HEAL) Study</strong><br />
              <a href="http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/surveys/heal/">http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/surveys/heal/</a>  <br />
              Supported by NCI&rsquo;s Applied Research Program (ARP), Division of Cancer  Control and Population Sciences, this study is investigating how lifestyle  factors such as weight and diet patterns, physical activity, and biomarker  profiles affect breast cancer prognosis and survival.&nbsp; NCI is particularly  interested in the interplay of these lifestyle factors because research  suggests that women who are overweight, obese, or physically inactive have a  poorer survival and increased breast cancer recurrence rate compared with  lighter-weight and physically active women. Data were collected shortly after  diagnosis as well as at two, five, and ten years post-diagnosis.  </p>

            <p><strong>BMI, Body Fat Distribution, and  Mortality Cohort Project</strong><br />
            Supported by NCI&rsquo;s Epidemiology and Genomics  Research Program (EGRP), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences,  this research initiative is assessing the association of waist circumference  with total and selected cause-specific (e.g., cardiovascular, cancer)  mortality. A secondary analysis will assess hip circumference and waist-to-hip  ratio. The project is using data on more than 650,000 participants from 11  cohorts in the BMI and Mortality and Physical Activity Pooling Projects.</p>
            <hr width="75%" align="center" noshade />
            <p><strong>Obesity and Fatal Prostate  Cancer in the BMI Pooling Project</strong><br />
              Supported by NCI&rsquo;s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP),  Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, this research initiative is  performing detailed evaluations of the relationship between BMI and wait-hip  ratio and lethal prostate cancer. This large prospective analysis of obesity  could provide critical information toward establishing whether obesity is  related to lethal prostate cancer, as well as the dose-response relationship, the  timing of exposure, and the role of central adiposity. The study will also  assess whether the association is confounded or modified by smoking, physical  activity, diabetes, and race.</p>
            <hr width="75%" align="center" noshade />
            <p><strong>Obesity and Rare Cancers in the  BMI Pooling Project</strong><br />
              Supported by NCI&rsquo;s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP),  Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, this research project is  evaluating the association between BMI and risks of thyroid, gallbladder, and head  and neck cancers, drawing on data from existing cancer cohorts. This large  prospective analysis could provide critical information toward establishing  whether these cancers are related to obesity.</p>
            <hr width="75%" align="center" noshade />
            <p><strong>Physical Activity and Risk of  Cancer in the Cohort Consortium</strong><br />
              Supported by NCI&rsquo;s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP),  Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, this research is assessing  the association between physical activity and individual cancer sites and  overall cancer burden. It will also include hazard ratios for each cancer site  studied to estimate the dose-response relationship between physical activity  and cancers of the breast, endometrium, and colon and rare cancers that have  not been adequately examined in prior physical activity studies.</p>
            <hr width="75%" align="center" noshade />
            <p><strong>Metabolomics of Energy Balance, Nutritional Status, and Cancer</strong> <br />
              <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/metabolomics/metabolomics-energy-balance-nutritional-status-cancer">http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/metabolomics/metabolomics-energy-balance-nutritional-status-cancer</a><br />
              A metabolic phenotype  represents the collection of all metabolites within a biological system and it  reflects the influence of both genetic and lifestyle factors. The goal of this  study is to identify specific metabolites or metabolic profiles that canb e  used as biomarkers for lifestyle-related exposures or as prospective markers  for cancer risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Division of Cancer Epidemiology (DCEG) Studies of Energy  Balance/Obesity and Cancer</strong> <br />
              <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/programs-ebp/neb/energy-obesity">http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/programs-ebp/neb/energy-obesity</a><br />
              Energy balance—the difference  between dietary energy intake and energy expended through physical activity and  resting metabolism—is thought to increase the risk of several important  cancers. The high prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity is a worldwide  public health issue, yet the mechanisms by which energy imbalance and obesity  cause cancer remain unclear. The web site has links to a variety of DCEG cohort  studies.</p>
